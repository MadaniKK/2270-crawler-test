Heterogeneous robots with different kinds of sensors are beneficial for exploration because they have different capabilities and may be able to search the area in different ways. However, it is extremely challenging to combine these measurements from different kinds of sensors. This project focuses on combining data from different kinds of sensors to build better maps, and on building maps that can be used by robots with different capabilities. Initially, we have focused on finding ways to represent information which is shared between different kinds of measurements, such as features which appear in point clouds created from different types of sensors, like LIDAR and stereo camera. We plan to do multi-robot SLAM and build maps with these features. We also plan additional work on improving map-building in groups of heterogeneous robots.

However, robot power and resources are limited, and without a continuous supply of these resources, robots would have significant downtime for recharging or refreshing other resources, which could be severely disruptive to their mission. In this project, we are developing a theoretical framework to deploy teams of robots (task robots) for exploration and surveillance while taking into account their energy and resource requirements. We envision a distribution center with replenishable resources (batteries, cameras etc.) that receives or predicts requests for fresh resources from deployed robots, and dispatches agile delivery robots (e.g., quadrotors) to deliver them in a timely manner. We will address the scheduling and prediction problem underlying this distribution task and propose solutions which generate near-optimal schedules for resource redistribution with multiple incoming requests from deployed robots. The framework will incorporate priorities on task robots which can be changed over time, and allow a relaxed delivery schedule if there are not enough delivery robots available. Delivery robots can also be dynamically re-routed to make efficient use of time and resources to sustain long-duration missions for robotic teams operating in a given region.

Our approach has the goal to make research in multi-robot systems safer, cheaper, and easier to reproduce. The Crazyswarm has the following features (amongst others): Safe operation near humans Small footprint allows to fly many vehicles in small lab spaces Good crash resistance because of low inertia Fully open-source Off-the-shelf hardware The system currently requires a motion capture system (e.g. VICON, OptiTrack, or PhaseSpace). More information, including tutorials on how to setup the Crazyswarm, can be found on its webpage .                    A video demonstrating the swarms' capabilities is shown below. We used the Crazyswarm to experimentally validate our trajectory planning approach for large quadrotor teams (see related publications below). In the future, we are looking at other applications, including distributed algorithms. Investigators In collaboration with the Robotic Embedded Systems Laboratory (RESL).

Typical approaches use groups with fixed hierarchies or the same simple algorithms on all robots, which may not work for unknown environments and complex problems. However, humans are very good at coordinating and adapting to changes in the environment. A major reason for this is their diversity. In a group, humans take different roles and work together to reach a better solution than they would individually. To understand the behaviors humans use to cooperate, we have developed an online multiplayer game in which a group of players must arrange themselves in a formation using only a limited view of their immediate surroundings, simulating a robot with a lidar sensor. We have observed that humans learn to complete this task efficiently, and take on diverse roles to ensure group success. Every group has some players who take a leading role and direct others into place, some who collaborate by joining groups and forming lines, and some who create anchors for the group to form around. Over several consecutive games, players maintain the same roles, and the group learns to tightly coordinate their actions. We plan to train diverse groups of autonomous agents and robots to use these same behaviors to coordinate on shape formation and other complex tasks. The video below shows a group playing the cooperative game with instructions to form a rectangle. Each participant has only the neighborhood view so can only see the area directly around their position. The players initially form several parts of shapes before finding the rest of the group, and show different roles and communication as they coordinate to form the final rectangle.

Nevertheless, the state-of-the art algorithms do not perform well in realistic conditions for robot groups.                    On the one hand, sampling or graph based methods which operate in joint space suffer from the dimensionality explosion.                    On the other hand, planners which try to avoid that effect make simplifying assumptions, limiting its practical applications. We investigate planning algorithms which work in realistic conditions (that is kinematic constraints and imperfect plan execution) for robot groups.                    Because there is always the possibility that a single robot fails, such plans need to be either be computable in a very short amount of time or it needs to be possible to update them online. The following video shows an example of a motion planning problem. The robots need to swap sides, but there is only a small corridor available. Nevertheless, we want to find a motion plan for each robot such that the overal swapping time is minimal (or within a specifiable factor away from the optimum).

While many algorithms have been developed to solve MAPF problems, there is no dominating optimal MAPF algorithm that works well in all types of problems and no standard guidelines for when to use which algorithm. In this work, we build deep learning network which takes a MAPF problem instance and attempts to select the fastest algorithm to use from a portfolio of algorithms. We improve the performance of our model by including single-agent shortest paths in the instance embedding given to our model and by utilizing supplemental loss functions in addition to a classification loss. We evaluate our model on a large and diverse dataset of MAPF instances, showing that it outperforms all individual algorithms in its portfolio as well as the state-of-the-art optimal MAPF algorithm selector. We also provide an analysis of algorithm behavior in our dataset to gain a deeper understanding of optimal MAPF algorithms' strengths and weaknesses to help other researchers leverage different heuristics in algorithm designs.

Preparing such a system for deployment often requires testing the robots in an environment shared with humans in order to resolve any unanticipated robot behaviors or reactions, which could be potentially dangerous to the human.In the case of a multi-robot system, uncertainty compounds and opportunities for error multiply, increasing the need for exhaustive testing in the shared environment but at the same time increasing the possibility of harm to both the robots and the human. As the number of components of the system (humans, robots, etc.) increases, controlling and debugging the system becomes more difficult. Allowing system components to operate in a combination of physical and virtual environments can provide a safer and simpler way to test these interactions, not only by separating the system components, but also by allowing a gradual transition of the system components into shared physical environments. Such a Mixed Reality platform is a powerful tool for testing that can address these issues and has been used to varying degrees in robotics and other fields. We present Mixed Reality as a tool for multi-robot research and discuss the necessary components for effective use. Furthermore, we present practical applications with different robots (Crazyflie 2 and TurtleBot 2) and simulation platforms (Gazebo, V-REP, and Unity 3D.)

[ PDF Preprint ] Copyright © ACT Lab 2018Toggle navigation ACT LAB RESEARCH PUBLICATIONS GROUP ADMISSION CONTACT Heterogeneous Multi-Target Tracking Home Heterogeneous Multi-Target Tracking Description Tracking multiple moving targets in a dynamic environment has many applications. For example, it can be used in surveillance, in sports events to keep track on where the players are, or for tracking the position of animals.                    Furthermore, if cameras are used for tracking, it is beneficial to maximize the visual coverage of the targets. This can be used in post-processing, for example in case of sports events to give detailed feedback about the players, or in case of animals to create 3D-Animations. To achieve both tracking and maximum visual coverage, the robots must collaborate and share sensor information.                    Moreover, planed paths need to take the limited fields of operation, occlusion, and obstacles into account. A video for the 2D-case is shown below. Assume there are cameras placed on differential drive robots. All robots collaborate to maximize the coverage (marked as green edges) and minimize the surface area which is not visible (red edges).                    Dynamic path planning is used to find a path to better configuration (blue lines). Investigators Wolfgang Hönig Nora Ayanian Related Publications W. Hönig and N. Ayanian .

While many algorithms have been developed to solve MAPF problems, there is no dominating optimal MAPF algorithm that works well in all types of problems and no standard guidelines for when to use which algorithm. In this work, we build deep learning network which takes a MAPF problem instance and attempts to select the fastest algorithm to use from a portfolio of algorithms. View Project Mapping with Heterogeneous Robots This project focuses on combining data from different kinds of sensors to build better maps, and on building maps that can be used by robots with different capabilities. View Project Motion Coordination for Multi-Robot Systems Traditional single-robot algorithms tend to be slow if applied to groups of robots due to the increased dimensionality of the state space.                On the other hands, multi-agent solutions from the artificial intelligence community can often not be directly applied to robots because they make invalid, simplifying assumptions. We investigate solutions that bridge the gap between AI and robotics, allowing to plan for large multi-robot systems. View Project Long-Duration Deployments of Heterogeneous Teams We develop both a theoretical framework and empirical models for extended autonomy in multirobot teams. Long-duration deployments require replenished resources, such as batteries and sensors. Our framework deals with both predicting when those resources will be needed, as well as ensuring that they are delivered in a timely manner to reduce robot down-time. View Project Crazyswarm The Crazyswarm is a swarm of miniature quadcopters (Crazyflie 2.0) that can fly together in close proximity.                  The size of the quadrotors allows safe operations near humans and indoor experiments with many vehicles even in tight lab spaces.                  The hardware is commercially available and the software (including ROS support) is available as open source.                  We use and maintain the Crazyswarm for research in multi-robot coordination. View Project Human-Inspired Multirobot Coordination We use a cooperative online multiplayer games to observe the behaviors and algorithms humans use to work together. By applying learning techniques to data from humans, we plan to create an ensemble of diverse controllers for robots that can be used together to complete complex tasks. View Project Multi-Robot-Human Interaction We focus on developing safer and more efficient interaction between multiple robots and humans. We apply reinforcement learning, verification, and human-robot interaction techniques to multiple different interaction scenarios and applications. View Project Mixed Reality for Robotics Mixed Reality can be a valuable tool for research and development in robotics. Specifically, our approach reduces the gap between simulation and implementation, and can eliminate safety concerns with human-robot interaction. View Project Old Projects... Heterogeneous Multi-Target Tracking We investigate algorithms for mobile robotic cameras to maximize the visual coverage of multiple moving targets in dynamic environments including obstacles. This approach has a variety of applications, including for surveillance, sports events, training, and documentation of endangered animals.

Our intellectual focus is creative applications of artificial intelligence: potential research topics include creative generative models (of visual and textual content), detecting “fake” generated content, AI for game playing, user experience design for creative AI systems, and more. Research in this field is poised to revolutionize the means of personal expression for everyone: in writing, photography, design, architecture, and more. Our REU Site is a partnership with The Leadership Alliance , a national consortium of more than 30 PhD-granting and Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) dedicated to training students from diverse cultural and academic backgrounds for graduate programs and professional research-based careers.        We encourage applications from students from historically-underrepresented groups, which includes (but is not limited to) students that identify as women, underrepresented minority (URM), having a disability, first-generation college, low-income, and/or LGBTQ+.        In addition to conducting original research, students at our site will participate in Alliance-led career development activities, professional networking opportunities, and social events. Apply to join us in Providence, Rhode Island this summer! How to Apply To apply for the program, submit an application via NSF ETAP: https://etap.nsf.gov/award/238/opportunity/6337 You will also need to submit an application to The Leadership Alliance's Summer Research Early Identification Program (SR-EIP): https://app.theleadershipalliance.org/ Please submit the same materials (statements, recommendation letters, etc.) to both applications. The application deadline is February 2, 2024 . Admission offers will be sent out on a rolling basis after the application deadline. About the Program Who is eligible to apply: US citizens or permanent residents who are enrolled in a degree program leading to a baccalaureate or associate degree. Students who are transferring from one college or university to another and are enrolled at neither institution during the summer may participate. High school graduates who have been accepted at an undergraduate institution but who have not yet started their undergraduate study are also eligible to participate. Students who have received their bachelor's degrees and are no longer enrolled as undergraduates are generally not eligible to participate. Experience needed: Prospective students should at minimum have completed an introductory computer science course sequence as well as mathematics courses covering calculus, linear algebra, and probability. Additional advanced coursework in areas related to the Site's theme (e.g. computer vision, machine learning) are helpful but not strictly required. Prior research experience is helpful but also not strictly required. Research activities: Participants will be paired with a faculty mentor and a graduate student mentor who will help guide them through a 9-week research project.        This includes a weekly study group which walks students through the process of conceiving, developing, and presenting an original research proposal.        In addition, the summer begins with crash courses on research methods, artificial intelligence and machine learning principles, and working with modern software tools for AI/ML. Other activities: In addition to their research projects, students will also have the opportunity to participate in Leadership Alliance-sponsored events including faculty and alumni panels on careers in research, graduate student panels on pathways to graduate school, group dinners, and more. We also plan to organize extracurricular social activities in the local area, such as visits to the RISD        museum, excursions to Newport and Rhode Island's beaches, and Saturday night visits to Providence's Waterfire celebration. Time commitment: The program runs 9 weeks, from June 3 through August 2, 2024. You can expect to spend ~35 hours a week on your research and an additional ~5 hours a week in other required program activities. Most research and activities will take place between 9-5 Monday - Friday. Optional weekend social activities will also be included. Funding: Participating students will receive a stipend of $6,480 for the summer, in three installments.

Together with an incoming student who was also chosen and one who was recognized as a finalist, they received recognition and support toward their education for the 2015-16 academic year as they become part of the next generation of diverse tech leaders. The students were awarded scholarships in several categories, achieving a level of representation that few Brown CS rivals matched: Sharon Lo '16 and Danaë Metaxa-Kakavouli '15 (incoming Stanford PhD student) won the Google Anita Borg Memorial Scholarship, awarded to 20 women students and leaders in CS Paige Selby M'16 and Eli White '18 won the Google Lime Award, awarded to 12 high-achieving CS students with disabilities Luis Aguirre '19 was one of 20 winners of the Generation Google Scholarship for incoming CS college students from underrepresented backgrounds Ebube Chuba '19 was also recognized as one of ten finalists for the Generation Google Scholarship. During the four-day retreat in Mountain View the scholars attended tech talks, networked with Google employees, participated in developmental activities and sessions, and attended social activities with the other Google scholars. "I personally would say I left the retreat really appreciative that I get to be part of the Brown community," Sharon says. "During the retreat, we had a talk from a program manager from Google X, one of Google's most innovative teams aimed at creating major 'moonshot' technological advancements and (surprise, but almost no surprise at all!) she was a Brown alum."Awards Categories Awards (                                        194 articles                                    ) Diversity (                                        11 articles                                    ) Socially Responsible Computing (                                        4 articles                                    ) Krishna Chaitanya Aluru Wins A Y Combinator Fellowship Posted by Jesse Polhemus on May 6, 2016 in Awards The YC Fellowship, an experiment from Y Combinator in helping create startups, has just put a Brown University student on the path toward using computing to significantly improve lives on a global scale. Krishna Chaitanya Aluru of the Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) and his collaborators Akshat Goenka (Wharton) and Vamsee Chamakura (IIIT) have just been admitted to the program for their "DocTalk" project, earning $20,000 and eight weeks of advice from the Y Combinator community to transform their idea into an actual startup. Currently, a single doctor in India serves an astonishing 1,800 patients. DocTalk, which features an app co-developed with Brown University student Justin Brower, will enable doctors to maximize the number of patients they can consult with by solving some of the inefficiencies in the current healthcare ecosystem in India. (Further details will remain proprietary until launch.) “Interviewing with YC was an incredible experience," Krishna says. "We felt so lucky to be able to sit across the table from people who founded and funded insanely successful companies and talk to them about our idea. YC calls you the same day of the interview to let you know whether you got in. We actually decided to watch Zootopia that evening to take our minds off of it. It was barely ten minutes into the movie when we got the phone call from one of the partners saying that we were accepted into the fellowship. Being accepted is the best motivation we could have asked for as we work on DocTalk over the next few months. We’re incredibly grateful and cannot wait to be a part of YC.” For more information, please click the link that follows to contact Brown CS Communication Outreach Specialist Jesse C.

It’s accompanied by an award in theexpected amount of $10,000 and an invitation to the Annual Google Scholars’Retreat. Layla and Molly (and fellow Brown University student, Eden Weizman)join multiple previous BrownCS recipients ofthe scholarship, including Tess Avitabile in 2010. “The more I learn about Anita Borg,” Layla shares, “the moreI admire her and the work she did to help promote diversity in computing. I thinkthis is the third time I’ve applied for this scholarship, so I’m justabsolutely thrilled to have been chosen as a recipient this year.” A key qualification for the scholarship is leadership in thecommunity and proven experience with inspiring other women to enter the field.Perhaps Molly’s most notable success in this area is the creation of Brown’sfirst annual hackathon, an event in which programmers and others collaboratedover the course of a weekend to create new software. “Working with Molly was amazing,” comments Mackenzie Clark,a co-founder of the event. “She is incredibly hard-working, responsible, anddedicated to everything she does. I can’t think of anyone more deserving ofthis award.” A few numbers support these accolades: 35% of hackathon attendeesidentified as female, 75% had never been to a hackathon before, and 100% saidthat they would return next year. Professor Tom Doeppner agrees. “I'm delighted to hear aboutMolly's award,” he says. “She's been extremely enthusiastic in pretty mucheverything she does, acting as a role model not only for women, but for all CSstudents. She's served as a UTA, she was the co-organizer of Hack@Brown, andnow she's the co-organizer of a CS senior yearbook.” When asked to describe Layla’s achievements, Associate Professor Amy Greenwald mentionsher work on the BrownCS Diversity Committee, her efforts to improve recruitmentof women, and both the design and implementation of key departmental diversityinitiatives. Citing Anita Borg’s ambition of creating male/female parity in thefield by 2020, Amy says, “If we had 1000 Layla’s all working toward this goalin their spare time –like she does– I honestly believe we could do it!” Associate Professor BenRaphael is equally enthusiastic: “I’m delighted that Layla's accomplishments are beingrecognized by the Google Anita Borg Memorial Scholarship. Layla is a first-rateresearcher and teacher of computer science and computational biology. Shealso works tirelessly to promote women in computer science, spearheadingdiversity initiatives in the department and in our research group. Theseexemplary qualities would make Anita Borg proud.” Thescholarship will only enhance the already remarkable work of the two women. “Thisaward was so competitive and it brings so many opportunities with it,” Mollyconcludes. “I’m ecstatic!” Her efforts and Layla’s will no doubt provideopportunities for an entire generation of colleagues present and future.Awards Categories Awards (                                        194 articles                                    ) Diversity (                                        11 articles                                    ) Socially Responsible Computing (                                        4 articles                                    ) Multiple Brown CS Collaborators Win Two Best Paper Award Runner Up Honors At HCOMP 2015 Posted by Jesse Polhemus on Nov. 20, 2015 in Awards The Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing (HCOMP), held this year in San Diego, is one of the most prominent conferences on the subject of human cooperation, computation, and crowdsourcing, and Brown University 's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS)  made a strong showing this year. Two different groups of students and faculty have been declared Best Paper Award Runner Up at the recent HCOMP 2015: Tropel: Crowdsourcing Detectors with Minimal Training Genevieve Patterson (Brown CS PhD student), Grant Van Horn (California Institute of Technology), Serge Belongie (Cornell University and Cornell Tech), and James Hays (former Brown CS faculty member) received the award for research ("Tropel: Crowdsourcing Detectors with Minimal Training") named after the word for "noisy crowd" in Spanish. Genevieve would also like to thank Ben Bauer (Brown CS undergraduate student), who contributed software to the project. "It was a big help and a pleasure to work with him," she says. Tropel is a system that enables non-technical users to create arbitrary visual detectors without first annotating a training set. "Our primary contribution," the researchers explain, " is a crowd active learning pipeline that is seeded with only a single positive example and an unlabeled set of training images. We examine the crowd’s ability to train visual detectors given severely limited training themselves. This paper presents a series of experiments that reveal the relationship between worker training, worker consensus and the average precision of detectors trained by crowd-in-the-loop active learning. In order to verify the efficacy of our system, we train detectors for bird species that work nearly as well as those trained on the exhaustively labeled CUB 200 dataset at significantly lower cost and with little effort from the end user. To further illustrate the usefulness of our pipeline, we demonstrate qualitative results on unlabeled datasets containing fashion images and street- level photographs of Paris."

Crowdsourcing from Scratch: A Pragmatic Experiment in Data Collection by Novice Requesters Alexandra Papoutsaki , (Brown CS PhD student), and collaborators Hua Guo (Brown CS PhD student), Danae Metaxa-Kakavouli (Brown CS alum), Connor Gramazio (Brown CS PhD student), Jeff Rasley (Brown CS PhD student), Wenting Xie (Brown University alum), Guan Wang (Brown CS PhD student), and Jeff Huang (Brown CS Assistant Professor) received the award for research ("Crowdsourcing from Scratch: A Pragmatic Experiment in Data Collection by Novice Requesters" ) that became something of an Internet sensation, attracting more than 20,000 views in a single week and 100,000 unique visitors to date, including academics, researchers, and potential graduate students. It's the result of a class assignment from the CS2951-L HCI seminar as taught by Jeff in Spring 2014 . All the other authors attended the class as students and were able to see an assignment turn into a peer-reviewed publication. For the undergraduates of the group (Danae and Wenting), it was their first in what will undoubtedly be a long line of publications. To determine how novice requesters design crowdsourcing tasks, the group conducted an experiment with a class of 19 students, each of whom tried their hand at crowdsourcing a real data collection task with a fixed budget and realistic time constraint. Students used Amazon Mechanical Turk to gather information about the academic careers of over 2,000 professors from 50 top Computer Science departments in America. In addition to curating this dataset, they classified the strategies which emerged, discussed design choices students made on task dimensions, and compared these novice strategies to best practices identified in crowdsourcing literature. Their work culminates in a summary of design pitfalls and effective strategies observed to provide guidelines for novice requesters. The data is publicly accessible, and the researchers are still allowing the public to help improve its accuracy at http://jeffhuang.com/computer_science_professors.html . The Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) group will also continue working and expanding both the dataset (including more universities across North America) and the research contributions.

SOSP is often considered the leading forum for researchers and developers of computer operating systems, and their research compared favorably with more than two dozen entries selected from over 300 global submissions, covering a wide range of theory and practice. Jonathan, Ryan, and Rodrigo’s work (“ Pivot Tracing: Dynamic Causal Monitoring for Distributed Systems ”) addresses the challenge of monitoring and troubleshooting distributing systems with a monitoring framework that combines techniques from both the dynamic instrumentation and causal tracing literature. Pivot Tracing gives users, at runtime, the ability to define arbitrary metrics at one point of the system, while being able to select, alter, and group by events meaningful at other parts of the system, even when crossing component or machine boundaries. The result is a dynamic and extensible solution that enables cross-tier analysis between inter-operating applications with low execution overhead. "This is the first framework we are aware of,” Rodrigo says, “that allows you to ask questions about a system as it runs, while causally combining metrics across its distributed components."Awards Categories Awards (                                        194 articles                                    ) Diversity (                                        11 articles                                    ) Socially Responsible Computing (                                        4 articles                                    ) Andrew Crotty Wins A Google PhD Fellowship Posted by Jesse Polhemus on May 26, 2016 in Awards Andrew Crotty of Brown University 's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) has just received a Google PhD Fellowship for his research in data management, particularly the design of big data analytics systems. His current work focuses on developing a new high-performance analytics platform, Tupleware , which is geared toward complex computations like machine learning. The fellowship, first launched in 2009, recognizes and supports outstanding graduate students doing exceptional research in computer science and related disciplines. It includes a monetary award and assigns each student a Google Research Mentor to serve as a resource. This year, there were 39 recipients from three different continents: Andrew is one of three winners in the Systems and Networking category, joining colleagues from the University of Cambridge and the University of California, Berkeley. "This was by far the most accomplished group of students we've seen, and each and every nominee should be proud," says Michael Rennaker of Google University Relations. Andrew's research, he explains, is predicated on the fact that data analytics has grown to include increasingly sophisticated techniques, such as machine learning and advanced statistics. "Frequently," he says, "users express these complex analytics tasks as workflows of user-defined functions (UDFs) that specify each algorithmic step. However, given typical hardware configurations and dataset sizes, the core challenge of complex analytics is no longer sheer data volume but rather the computation itself, and the next generation of analytics frameworks must focus on optimizing for this computation bottleneck. While query compilation has gained widespread popularity as a way to tackle the computation bottleneck for traditional SQL workloads, relatively little work addresses UDF-centric workflows in the domain of complex analytics." Crotty's research has primarily focused on the creation of a novel architecture for automatically compiling workflows of UDFs and co-developing several related optimizations that consider properties of the data, UDFs, and hardware together in order to generate different code on a case-by-case basis. These techniques are currently being implemented in Tupleware, a new high-performance distributed analytics system whose benchmarks show performance improvements of up to three orders of magnitude compared to alternative systems. The fellowship is the latest recognition in a busy year for Andrew: he's recently published papers on a variety of topics from compiling UDF-centric workflows to redesigning traditional data management algorithms for high-performance networks to providing interactive analytics through pen and touch. He and other Brown CS colleagues also won a Best Demo Award at VLDB 2015 . "It's a big honor to be awarded the Google fellowship," Andrew says, "especially this year being included among so many other outstanding recipients. I'm really looking forward to continuing the exciting work we've been doing with Tupleware and exploring applications to new areas, including interactive data analysis and genomics pipelines."Awards Categories Awards (                                        194 articles                                    ) Diversity (                                        11 articles                                    ) Socially Responsible Computing (                                        4 articles                                    ) Esha Ghosh, Olya Ohrimenko, And Roberto Tamassia Win The ACNS 2015 Best Student Paper Award Posted by Jesse Polhemus on June 2, 2015 in Awards PhD candidate Esha Ghosh , PhD alumna Olya Ohrimenko, and professor Roberto Tamassia of Brown University ’s Computer Science Department have been selected for the Best Student Paper Award at the 13th International Conference on Applied Cryptography and Network Security (ACNS 2015), to be held in New York on June 2-5, 2015. “With the advent of cloud computing,” Esha explains, “a huge amount of sensitive data gets outsourced. While integrity is essential in accessing outsourced data, privacy is a very important aspect too. Most importantly, since many of the clients accessing this data are small computing devices, efficiency is crucial. There have been attempts to address these issues separately in the past. In this work, we address these issues comprehensively, propose a formal model, and give a very efficient construction for supporting order queries and order statistics on list data.” Their work (“Zero-Knowledge Authenticated Order Queries and Order Statistics on a List”), which Esha will present on the afternoon of June 3, shares the honor with one other paper. In addition to the competitive nature of ACNS, which has a historical acceptance rate in the range of 12-23%, the Best Student Paper Award is the only award given by the conference, chosen from all accepted papers with a student among the authors. “I am delighted by the recognition given to our paper,” says Roberto, “which is part of an ambitious project aimed at providing an unprecedented level of security and privacy to cloud computing applications.” “This project began,” says Olya, “when Esha and I were sharing an office, and it’s continued across the Atlantic after I moved to Microsoft Research. It’s a great example of both close and remote collaboration.”Awards Categories Awards (                                        194 articles                                    ) Diversity (                                        11 articles                                    ) Socially Responsible Computing (                                        4 articles                                    ) Foreign Policy Magazine Names Tellex And Oberlin 2016 Global Thinkers Posted by Jesse Polhemus on Dec. 12, 2016 "When we consider as we do each year the work of the world's leading thinkers," writes David Rothkopf, CEO and Editor of the FP Group, which publishes Foreign Policy Magazine, "we find that the vast majority of them —in science, technology, business, culture and government— are actually moving us forward and helping to solve the problems of the past. That's encouraging...and that's what we are acknowledging with this issue.” This year, Foreign Policy included Assistant Professor Stefanie Tellex and PhD candidate John Oberlin of Brown University' s Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) in their 2016 list of Leading Global Thinkers, placing them in the Innovators category.

HRL methods can accelerate learning because they enable agents to break down a task that may require a relatively long sequence of decisions into a set of subtasks that only require short sequences of decisions.  HRL methods enable agents to decompose problems into simpler subproblems because HRL approaches train agents to learn multiple levels of policies that each specialize in making decisions at different time scales.  Figure 1 shows an example of how hierarchy can shorten the lengths of the sequences of actions that an agent needs to learn.  While a non-hierarchical agent (left side of Figure 1) must learn the full sequence of joint torques needed to swing up and balance the pole, a task that is often prohibitively difficult to learn,  the 2-level agent (right side of Figure 1) only needs to learn relatively short sequences.  The high-level of the agent only needs to learn a sequence of subgoals (purple cubes) to achieve the task goal (yellow cube), and the low-level of the agent only needs to learn the sequences of joint torques to achieve each subgoal. Figure 1: Video compares the actions sequences that need to be learned by a non-hierarchical agent (left) and a 2-level hierarchical agent (right) in order to complete the task.  While the non-hierarchical agent needs to learn the full sequence of joint torques that move the agent from its initial state to the goal state (i.e., yellow cube), the 2-level agent only needs to learn relatively short sequences of decisions.  The high-level of the agent just needs to learn the short sequence of subgoals (i.e., purple cubes) needed to achieve the goal.  The low-level only needs to learn the short sequences of joint torques needed to achieve each subgoal (i.e., purple cube). Yet, in order for hierarchical agents to take advantage of these short decision sequences and realize the potential of faster learning, hierarchical agents need to be able to learn their multiple levels of policies in parallel. That is, at the same time one level in the hierarchy is learning the sequence of subtasks needed to solve a task, the level below should be learning the sequence of shorter time scale actions needed to solve each subtask. The alternative is to learn the hierarchy of policies one level at a time in a bottom-up fashion, but this strategy both may forfeit the sample efficiency gains hierarchy offers and can be difficult to implement. Learning multiple levels of policies in parallel, however, is hard because it is inherently unstable. Changes in a policy at one level of the hierarchy may cause changes in the transition and reward functions at higher levels in the hierarchy, making it difficult to jointly learn multiple levels of policies. In this post, we present a new Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning framework, Hierarchical Actor-Critic (HAC) , that enables hierarchical agents to efficiently learn multiple levels of policies in parallel. The main idea behind HAC is to train each level of the hierarchy independently of the lower levels by training each level as if the lower levels are already optimal. This strategy yields stable transition and reward functions at all levels and thus makes it easier to learn multiple levels of policies simultaneously. The HAC framework is able to simulate optimal lower level policy hierarchies as a result of two components: (i) a particular hierarchical policy architecture and (ii) three types of transitions that take advantage of hindsight. Our empirical results in a variety of discrete and continuous domains show that hierarchical agents trained with HAC can learn tasks significantly faster than both non-hierarchical agents and hierarchical agents trained with another leading HRL approach. Further, to the best of our knowledge, our results include the first 3-level agents trained in tasks with continuous state and action spaces. The remainder of the post is structured as follows. In the first section, we describe in more detail the instability issues that arise when agents try to learn to make decisions at multiple time scales. In the second section, we present our HRL framework and show how it can reduce this instability and thereby help agents to learn multiple levels of policies simultaneously. In the third section, we discuss the experiments we implemented and the results obtained. In final section of the post, we provide some concluding remarks. For a more detailed description of our approach and experiments, please see our ICLR 2019 paper .  For open-sourced software to implement our framework, please check out our GitHub repository .  In addition, for the video presentation of our experiments, please see the following video . Instability in Hierarchical RL Learning multiple levels of policies simultaneously is problematic due to non-stationary transition and reward functions that naturally emerge. Hierarchical policies almost always use some sort of nested structure. Beginning with the top level, each level will propose a temporally extended action and the level below has a certain number of attempts to try to execute that temporally extended action. Thus, for any temporally extended action from any level above the base level, the next state that action results in and potentially the reward of that action depend on the policies below that level. As a result, when all levels in the hierarchy are learned simultaneously, the transition function and potentially the reward function for any level above the base level may continue to change as long as the policies below that level continue to change. For an example of non-stationary transition functions in hierarchical policies, consider the 2-level toy robot in the video in Figure 2 below. The high-level of this agent attempts to break down the task by setting subgoals for the low-level to achieve. The video shows four different occasions in which the high-level of the agent proposes state B as a subgoal when the agent is currently in state A . Yet due to the nested structure of the 2-level agent, the next state that this high-level action results in after a certain number of attempts (in this case 5) by the low-level will depend on the policy of the low-level. But since the low-level should be improving and likely also exploring over time, the next state that this subgoal action results in will change over time. Iteration State Action Next State 1 A B C 2 A B D 3 A B E 4 A B B Figure 2: Example of non-stationary transition functions that arise when learning hierarchical policies. In this example, when the robot proposes subgoal state B when in state A, the next state that this action results in changes over time as the low-level policy changes. Similarly, non-stationary reward functions can also arise when trying to learning multiple levels of policies simultaneously. Figure 3 shows an example in which a 2-level robot proposes and achieves the same subgoal on two different occasions, but receives transitions with different rewards because the agent follows different paths to the subgoal. Iteration State Action Reward Next State 1 A B -13 B 2 A B -4 B Figure 3: Example of non-stationary reward functions that arise when learning hierarchical policies.  In this example, even though in both iterations the agent is able to achieve subgoal B, the low-level takes different paths so the same subgoal action may yield different rewards.  In this case, the reward function is assumed to be -1 for any primitive action that does not achieve the goal of task (not shown) and 0 otherwise. Non-stationary transition and reward functions are a significant concern because they make it difficult to learn effective policies.  RL algorithms typically estimate the expected long-term value of action in state (i.e., ) as the sum of the immediate reward and the discounted value of the current policy in the succeeding state (i.e., ): $$Q_{Target}(s_t, a_t) = r_{t+1} + \gamma V_{\pi}(s_{t+1}).$$ If and do not have stationary distributions for the same state-action pair, Q-values will not stabilize and it will be difficult to value individual actions, which in turn will make it difficult to learn effective policies.  Thus, in order for the hierarchical agent to learn all of its policies in parallel and realize the sample efficiency benefits of HRL, the non-stationary transition and reward functions that occur at all levels above the base level will need to be overcome. Hierarchical Actor-Critic (HAC) The key problem described above is that if all of the levels of the hierarchy are to be trained in parallel, the temporally extended actions from any level cannot be evaluated with respect to the current hierarchy of policies below that level. This lower level hierarchy will continue to change as long as these lower level policies both learn from experience and explore. Changes in lower level policies in turn will cause non-stationary transitions and rewards functions at higher levels that will make it difficult to learn effective policies at those higher levels. The central idea of our approach, Hierarchical Actor-Critic (HAC), is that instead of evaluating the temporally extended actions with respect to the current lower level hierarchy of policies, evaluate the temporally extended actions with respect to where the lower level hierarchy is headed — an optimal lower level hierarchy. The optimal lower level hierarchy, which consists of optimal versions of all lower level policies, does not change over time. As a result, the distribution of succeeding states and rewards for any temporally extended action will be stable, enabling the hierarchical agent to learn its multiple levels of policies in parallel. Agents that learn with the HAC framework are able to train each non-base level of the hierarchy with respect to optimal versions of lower level policies without actually needing the optimal lower level policy hierarchy as a result of the framework’s two major components: (i) the particular architecture of the hierarchical policy HAC agents learn and (ii) three types of transitions that the agent uses to evaluate actions. Hierarchical Policy Architecture Agents trained with HAC learn hierarchical policies with the following structural properties. Deterministic, Goal-Conditioned Policies HAC agents learn -level hierarchical policies that consist of deterministic, goal-conditioned policies.  The number of levels, , is a hyperparameter chosen by the user.  Thus, at each level , the agent learns a policy that maps the current state and goal of the level to an action: .  The goal will typically be an individual state or a set of states.  The space of goals for the highest level of the hierarchy is determined by the user.  The goals for all other levels are determined by the actions from the level above. Action Space = State Space for Non-Base Levels HAC agents divide tasks into shorter horizon subtasks using the state space. That is, each policy above the base level attempts to decompose the task of achieving its goal state into a short sequence subgoal states to achieve along the way. Setting the action space of the non-base levels of the hierarchy to be the state space is critical because it makes it simple for the agent to create transitions that simulate an optimal lower level policy hierarchy, which will ultimately help the agent learn multiple levels of policies in parallel. We will explain in more detail why this is the case during our discussion of the three types of transitions HAC agents use to evaluate actions. In addition, the action space for the base level of the hierarchy is the set of primitive actions available to the agent. Nested Policies The hierarchical policies learned by HAC agents are also nested in order to make it easier for higher levels in the hierarchy to learn to act at longer time scales.  When a non-base level outputs a subgoal state, this subgoal is passed down to level as its next goal.  Level then has at most attempts to achieve this goal state, in which is a hyperparameter set by the user. Figure 4 shows the architecture of a 3-level agent trained with HAC. Figure 4: Architecture of a 3-level hierarchical policy using HAC.  Each of the three policies is deterministic and goal-conditioned as each policy takes an input the current state and goal state.  The top two levels have an action space equal to the state space as these policies will output subgoal states for lower levels to achieve.  The bottom level will output primitive actions.  Further, each level has H actions to achieve its goal state before another goal is provided. Three Types of Transitions In addition to the structure of the hierarchical policy, HAC agents are able to efficiently learn multiple levels of policies simultaneously as a result of three types of transitions HAC agents use to evaluate actions. We describe each of these transitions next. In order to make these transitions easier to understand, we will make use of the example episode shown in Figure 5 below, in which a 2-level robot is trying to move from its initial state ​ to the yellow flag. Figure 5: Example episode of a 2-level agent trying to move from the initial state to the yellow flag. The pink circles with the label represent the original subgoal state proposed by the high-level of the agent at step The gray circles with the label indicate the state of the agent after primitive actions by the low-level policy following the proposal of subgoal Hindsight Action Transitions In order to efficiently learn multiple policies in parallel, the non-base levels of the hierarchy need transitions that evaluate actions as if the lower level policies are already optimal.  This is the purpose of the first set of HAC transitions, which we refer to as hindsight action transitions.  Hindsight action transitions are implemented using a simple procedure: replace the proposed action with the action that was actually executed in hindsight.  For non-base levels of the agent that propose subgoals, this means that whenever a level proposes some subgoal state but the level below misses that subgoal state and ends in some other state after attempts, the hindsight action transition will use the state the agent ended in as the original subgoal action.  With this change, the action and next state components in the transition will be the same and thus hindsight action transitions can simulate how an optimal lower level policy hierarchy would act.  In addition, for the reward component of the transition, the reward will only depend on (i) the state reached after attempts and (ii) the goal state for the level in consideration.  The reward will not take into consideration the exact path taken to the state reached after attempts because the goal is to create transitions that simulate an optimal lower level policy hierarchy and it is not known what path an optimal lower level policy hierarchy would take.  The reward will also be sparse and binary to avoid the issues that arise when reward functions are manually engineered.  Specifically, the reward for each level, will be 0 for any action in which and -1 otherwise. Figure 6 shows the hindsight action transitions that would be created for the high-level of the agent in the example episode in Figure 5.  Note that had the high-level had access to the optimal version of the low-level policy, the transition would look the same.

For the low-level of the agent, the hindsight action transitions will be the typical transitions created for flat agents. Hindsight Goal Transitions Although hindsight action transitions help hierarchical agents jointly learn multiple levels of policies by reducing the non-stationary transition and reward function issues, they introduce another problem — how to learn multiple levels of policies with only sparse reward functions.  The HAC framework attempts to overcome this problem by supplementing agents with a second type of transition, which we refer to as hindsight goal transitions .  Hindsight goal transitions make it easier to learn multiple level of policies in sparse reward settings by essentially extending the idea of Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) ( Andrychowicz et al., 2017 ) to the hierarchical setting.  HER helps agents learn to reach different goal states in sparse reward domains by generalizing from the agent’s experience achieving other goal states.  HER is implemented by creating copies of the original transitions and replacing the original goal state with a state that was actually achieved during the episode.  The original reward is also replaced with the appropriate reward given the new goal state.   Hindsight goal transitions are implemented in the same manner as HER transitions except that in non-base levels of the hierarchy, hindsight goal transitions are made from copies of the hindsight action transitions. Figure 7 lists the hindsight goal transitions created for the high-level after the example episode in Figure 5 assuming the last state that was reached, , is used as the new goal state.  Figure 8 lists the hindsight goal transitions created for the low-level after the 5 attempts to try to achieve the first subgoal assuming the state is used as the new subgoal.  Note that the last transition in these tables now includes the sparse reward of 0 and a discount rate of 0.  Each level of the agent can now use this “knowledge” of how to reach these goal states to generalize to other goal states.

Subgoal Testing Transitions Hindsight action and hindsight goal transitions help agents learning multiple levels of policies in parallel using only sparse reward functions, yet a significant problem still remains.  These transitions only enable non-base levels to learn Q-values for subgoal states that can actually be achieved within steps by the level below.  They ignore subgoal states that cannot be reached in actions.  Ignoring a region of the subgoal action space is problematic because the critic function may assign relatively high Q-values to these actions, which may then incentivize the level’s policy to output these unrealistic subgoals.  For discrete domains, HAC overcomes this issue with pessimistic Q-value initializations.  For continuous domains, HAC supplements agents with a third type of transition, which we refer to as subgoal testing transitions . Subgoal testing transitions help agents overcome this issue by penalizing subgoal actions that cannot be achieved with the current lower level policy hierarchy.  Subgoal testing transitions are implemented as follows.  After a non-base level proposes a subgoal, a certain fraction of the time that level will decide to test whether the policy hierarchy below that level can achieve the proposed subgoal.  All lower levels then must greedily follow their policy and not add exploration noise.  If the level below is not able to achieve the proposed subgoal in actions, the level that proposed the subgoal is penalized with a subgoal testing transition that contains some low reward value.  In our experiments, we used a reward value of for this penalty.  As an example of a subgoal testing transition, assume that when the 2-level robot in Figure 5 was in state , the high-level of the robot decided to test whether the low-level could achieve the proposed subgoal .  The low-level policy then had to follow its policy exactly for steps.  Because the low-level policy failed to achieve , the high-level would receive the subgoal testing transition below.  Note that this transition uses a discount rate of 0 to avoid any non-stationary transition function issues. Subgoal testing transitions thus help agents assign low Q-values to unrealistic subgoals because these subgoal actions will be penalized during subgoal testing. Using these three types of transitions, the policy at each level of the hierarchy can then be trained with an off-policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm (e.g., Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) ( Lillicrap et al., 2015 )).  The critic or Q-function at each level will take the form of a Universal Value Function Approximator ( Schaul et al., 2015 ) that maps states, goals, and actions to the real number space: . The hierarchical architecture and the three types of transitions constitute the bulk of the HAC framework.  For the full HAC algorithm, please see our ICLR 2019 paper .  For open-sourced software to implement our approach, please see our GitHub repository . Experiments We evaluated our approach on both (i) discrete state and action space and (ii) continuous state and action space environments.  The discrete tasks consisted on two grid world tasks: (i) 10x10 grid world and (ii) four rooms.  The continuous domains consisted of the following four tasks built in MuJoCo ( Todorov et al., 2012 ): (i) inverted pendulum, (ii) UR5 reacher, (iii) ant reacher, and (iv) ant four rooms. Using these environments, we performed two comparisons.  The first comparison we implemented compared agents using 1 (i.e., flat), 2, and 3 levels.  The purpose of this comparison was to evaluate our hypothesis that HAC agents with more levels of hierarchy could learn new tasks with better sample efficiency as they can divide tasks into shorter horizon subtasks and solve these simpler subtasks in parallel.  In this experiment, the flat agents used Q-Learning + HER in the discrete tasks and DDPG + HER in the continuous domains.  Figure 9 below compares the performance of each agent type in all of the tasks listed above.  The green, blue, and red lines represent the performance of 1, 2, and 3-level agents, respectively.  In all tasks, hierarchical agents significantly outperformed the 1-level agents.  Further, in all tasks, the 3-level agents outperformed, often significantly, the 2-level agents. Figure 9: Results of 1 vs. 2 vs. 3-Level Agent Comparison. Below we show two short videos from our ant experiments.  For the full video presentation showing all of our experiments, please see our YouTube video . 2-Level Ant Reacher Figure 10: 2-Level HAC agent in the ant reacher task.  The task goal is the yellow cube.  Subgoal actions from the high-level policy are represented by the purple cubes.

Subgoal actions from the high-level and mid-level policies are represented by the green and purple cubes, respectively.  Low-level policy outputs joint torques. The second comparison we implemented compared HAC to another leading HRL algorithm, HIRO (HIerarchical Reinforcement learning with Off-policy correction) ( Nachum et al, 2018 ).  HIRO, which was developed simultaneously and independently to our approach, trains 2-level agents with a similar architecture to our approach and can also learn off-policy as in our approach.  However, HIRO does not use either of our hindsight transitions, and therefore should not be able to learn multiple levels of policies in parallel as efficiently as our approach can.  We compared 2-Level HAC with HIRO in the inverted pendulum, UR reacher, and ant reacher tasks.  The results are shown in Figure 12 below.  The green and blue lines represent the performance of HIRO and 2-Level HAC, respectively.  In all tasks, 2-level HAC significantly outperforms HIRO. Figure 12: Comparison of 2-Level HAC vs HIRO in the (left) inverted pendulum, (middle) UR5 reacher, and (right) ant reacher tasks. Conclusion Hierarchy has the potential to accelerate learning but in order to realize this potential, hierarchical agents need to be able to learn their multiple levels of policies in parallel.  In this post, we present a new HRL framework that can efficiently learn multiple levels of policies simultaneously.  HAC can overcome the instability issues that arise when agents try to learn to make decisions at multiple time scales because the framework primarily trains each level of the hierarchy as if the lower levels are already optimal.  Our results in several discrete and continuous domains, which include the first 3-level agents in tasks with continuous state and action spaces, confirm that HAC can significantly improve sample efficiency.

Putting items in a drawer, opening a door, and retrieving a frosty beverage from a refrigerator are just a few examples of the tasks we’d like our domestic robots to be capable of. However, this is a difficult problem for today’s robots: refrigerators, for example, come in different shapes, sizes, and colors, are in different locations, etc, so control policies trained on individual objects do not readily generalize to new instances of the same class. Humans, on the other hand, learn to manipulate household objects with remarkable efficiency. As a child, we learn to interact with our refrigerator, then readily manipulate the refrigerators we encounter in the houses of our friends and relatives. This is because humans recognize the underlying task structure: these objects almost always consist of the same kinds of parts, despite looking a bit different each time. In order for our robots to achieve generalizable manipulation, they require similar priors. This post details our recent work towards this end, training robots to generalize kinematic models to novel objects. After identifying kinematic structures for many examples of an object class, our model learns to predict kinematic model parameters, articulated pose, and object geometry for novel instances of that class, ultimately enabling manipulation from only a handful of observations of a static object. Kinematic Models Kinematic models are commonly used to represent the relative motion of two rigid bodies. In particular, they describe a body’s forward kinematics: the position and orientation of an articulated part as a function of the state of a joint (the angle of a door or the displacement of a drawer, for example). The most common model types are revolute (like a door) or prismatic (like a drawer), but others exist as well (rigid, spherical, screw, etc). These models are parameterized by their position and orientation in space; for example, in the revolute model, the parameters consist of a) the axis about which the door rotates and b) the spatial relationship between the axis and the origin of the door. A kinematic graph represents all of an object’s parts and the kinematic models between them. Nodes in the graph represent the object’s parts, and edges encode model types and model parameters. For example, in Figure 1, the cabinet pictured can be abstracted into three nodes and two edges, with the rotation between the body and the door encoded in the edge between the respective parts. Figure 1: An example object and its corresponding kinematic graph, annotated with the pose of the axis of rotation. To summarize, each node in the graph represents a part, and each edge in the graph consists of: Model type, denoted , between a part and its parent (revolute, prismatic, …) . Kinematic model parameters, , the axis of rotation/translation and the resting pose of that part. The state (or configuration ) of the joint, denoted , an angle in revolute models and a displacement in prismatic models. These quantities enable the robot to simulate how the object parts move about each other. If a robot can identify them, it can begin to reason about how to manipulate an object. A large body of literature explores fitting kinematic models to individual objects, requiring part motion generated by either a human demonstrator or by the robot itself. Critically, these approaches fit models to each object from scratch: a demonstration is required for every new object, no matter how similar each is to those experienced previously. This results in a robot which has to deliberately explore every object it encounters, without ever learning the underlying structure in its experiences with those objects. This is insufficient for a robot operating autonomously in a new household environment, where every object it sees will be new. Generalizing to New Objects In contrast, our models are trained to predict kinematic model parameters from observations of static objects, providing the agent with a useful prior over a novel object’s articulation. We choose to categorize objects according to their part connectivity ; once we do so, if our agent can recognize objects, it can identify the kinematic graph structure which represents a novel object. In particular, it will have the same connectivity as all other instances of that class. This enables us to define a template for each object class, then train neural network models which regress from depth images to the parameters of the kinematic model between each pair of parts, as well as the state of each of the object’s joints and a simple parameterization of the object’s geometry. After being trained in simulation, the models are capable of predicting kinematic model parameters for real, novel objects from individual observations. We show that this is sufficient for manipulating new instances of familiar object classes without first seeing a demonstration. Model The task of our neural network models is to predict the parameters of the kinematic model specified by the object’s class, , the object’s present articulated pose, , and a parameterization of the object’s geometry, , given the object’s class label, denoted , and a depth image of the object at time , . In order to enable the agent to express confidence in its estimates and reason about sequential observations in a principled way, we trained mixture density networks for each object class, which parameterize a mixture of Gaussian distributions over , , and . The mixture density networks consist of three neural networks, , , and , which represent the means, covariances, and weights of the mixture components, respectively. We trained ResNet backbones jointly with the mixture density networks. The resulting estimate of the joint distribution over model parameters, articulated pose, and object geometry has the following form: $$ p(\phi, q_t, \theta \mid x_t, c) = \sum_i^m \pi_i^c(x_t) \mathcal{N}( \phi, q_t, \theta  \mid \mu_i^c(x_t), \sigma_i^c(x_t) ).$$ In order to train the models, we require annotated depth images of articulated objects. Given the labels, the models are trained by maximizing the probability of the true labels under the parameterized mixture of gaussians: $$ \mathcal{L} = - \mathbb{E}\left[ \log{ p(\phi, q_t, \theta | x_t, c) } \right]. $$ Dataset In the absence of an annotated collection of real articulated objects, we procedurally generated objects from geometric primitives, simulated them in Mujoco, rendered synthetic depth images, and recorded ground truth parameters. We did so for six object classes: cabinet, drawer, microwave, toaster oven, two-door cabinet, and refrigerator. Note that we need to classify cabinets into two categories according to the number of articulated parts due to our classification scheme described above. Ongoing work seeks to relax this by learning to identify part connectivity from pointclouds, too. Some samples from the dataset are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2: Sample simulated objects. The models are trained on many examples of a class, then tested on novel instances. Categories from the top: cabinet, drawer, microwave, toaster oven, cabinet2, refrigerator. Manipulating Novel Objects Once our models are trained, they enable a robot to estimate kinematic models for novel objects without first seeing demonstrations of their part mobility.Using an estimated kinematic model, after obtaining a grasp on the object, the agent is able to compute a path of its end-effector through space that sets the object’s degree of freedom to a desired setting while obeying the constraints imposed by the object’s joints. We demonstrated this with two real objects that the robot was not previously trained on: a microwave, and a drawer. Please see the video below for footage of the demonstrations. Conclusion It’s critical that a robot operating autonomously in new environments be capable of interacting with novel articulated objects.Existing approaches demonstrate how an agent might acquire a model of a novel object through exploration, but they fail to provide the agent with a useful prior over how the object might move.As such, the resulting exploration is time consuming and must be repeated from scratch for every object.Our work presented here provides a framework for learning to generalize these models to new objects, ultimately enabling zero-shot manipulation of novel instances of familiar object classes.

We believe that these fully integrated, generally intelligent agents should be robots: embodied systems which perceive the world through their sensors, affect the world through their actuators, and interact with humans in complex environments. In order to build these agents, we are drawing on our faculty's expertise in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing, and applying cutting-edge ideas to the full AI problem: building machines that learn, reason, and communicate about the natural world. It is our hope that together we can build the world’s first truly generally intelligent robot. Welcome to bigAI @ Brown. Let’s get started!

Continue reading Learning to Generalize Kinematic Models to Novel Objects Ben Abbatematteo November 4, 2019 Objects with articulated parts are ubiquitous in household tasks. Putting items in a drawer, opening a door, and retrieving a frosty beverage from a refrigerator are just a few examples of the tasks we’d like our domestic robots to be capable of. However, this is a difficult problem for today’s robots: refrigerators, for example, come in different shapes, sizes, and colors, are in different locations, etc, so control policies trained on individual objects do not readily generalize to new instances of the same class. Humans, on the other hand, learn to manipulate household objects with remarkable efficiency. As a child, we learn to interact with our refrigerator, then readily manipulate the refrigerators we encounter in the houses of our friends and relatives. This is because humans recognize the underlying task structure: these objects almost always consist of the same kinds of parts, despite looking a bit different each time. In order for our robots to achieve generalizable manipulation, they require similar priors. This post details our recent work towards this end, training robots to generalize kinematic models to novel objects. After identifying kinematic structures for many examples of an object class, our model learns to predict kinematic model parameters, articulated pose, and object geometry for novel instances of that class, ultimately enabling manipulation from only a handful of observations of a static object. Continue reading Learning Multi-Level Hierarchies with Hindsight Andrew Levy September 4, 2019 Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) has the potential to accelerate learning in sequential decision making tasks like the inverted pendulum domain shown in Figure 1 where the agent needs to learn a sequence of joint torques to balance the pendulum.  HRL methods can accelerate learning because they enable agents to break down a task that may require a relatively long sequence of decisions into a set of subtasks that only require short sequences of decisions.  HRL methods enable agents to decompose problems into simpler subproblems because HRL approaches train agents to learn multiple levels of policies that each specialize in making decisions at different time scales.  Figure 1 shows an example of how hierarchy can shorten the lengths of the sequences of actions that an agent needs to learn.  While a non-hierarchical agent (left side of Figure 1) must learn the full sequence of joint torques needed to swing up and balance the pole, a task that is often prohibitively difficult to learn,  the 2-level agent (right side of Figure 1) only needs to learn relatively short sequences.  The high-level of the agent only needs to learn a sequence of subgoals (purple cubes) to achieve the task goal (yellow cube), and the low-level of the agent only needs to learn the sequences of joint torques to achieve each subgoal. Figure 1: Video compares the actions sequences that need to be learned by a non-hierarchical agent (left) and a 2-level hierarchical agent (right) in order to complete the task.  While the non-hierarchical agent needs to learn the full sequence of joint torques that move the agent from its initial state to the goal state (i.e., yellow cube), the 2-level agent only needs to learn relatively short sequences of decisions.  The high-level of the agent just needs to learn the short sequence of subgoals (i.e., purple cubes) needed to achieve the goal.  The low-level only needs to learn the short sequences of joint torques needed to achieve each subgoal (i.e., purple cube). Continue reading DeepMellow - Removing the Need for Target Networks in Deep Q-Learning Seungchan Kim August 12, 2019 In this paper, we proposed an approach to remove the need for a target network from Deep Q-learning. Our DeepMellow algorithm, the combination of Mellowmax operator and DQN, can learn stably without a target network when tuned with specific temperature parameter ω. We proved novel theoretical properties (convexity, monotonic increase, and overestimation bias reduction) of Mellowmax operator, and empirically showed that Mellowmax operator can obviate the need for a target network in multiple domains.

Could anything be more valuable to a young startup than expert-led coaching sessions on how to identify opportunities and design business models, or the chance to pitch ideas to industry leaders? Probably not much, but a check for $100,000 might be a close contender. NYU Stern's W. R. Berkley Innovation Labs $300K Entrepreneurs Challenge, held at New York University's Stern School of Business, offers all those things. Last week, PhD Candidate Thomas Dickerson of Brown University 's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) returned from the competition with some valuable experience and one of those comically-oversized checks that are almost too big for one person to carry. After months of workshops, coaching sessions, and deliverables, his startup, Geopipe, was selected for its potential for great impact, challenging assumed boundaries, and inspiring a sense of what's possible. It won the top prize of $100,000 in the Challenge's Technology Venture Competition. Co-founded last year with Dr. Christopher Mitchell, a New York University alum, Geopipe builds algorithms to turn 2D and 3D data into highly detailed 3D virtual models. Their system ingests and analyzes data, including satellite photos, maps, laser scans, and much more. It then combines machine learning with a distributed systems approach to rapidly correlate data sources, understand structure, and produce complete 3D models at many different scales. One of Geopipe's strengths is that it offers more semantic modeling than competing solutions with massive amounts of content while coupling models to real-world data without a great deal of manual effort. It puts models in the hands of customers, who can use them in their own software suites with automatic customization options at a consistently high level of visual quality. "This is an extremely important moment for Geopipe," says Thomas, "and we'll put the money to good use. We have a pretty extensive R&D road-map for the next 12 months, and we're looking to balance pushing that with getting hands-on feedback through pilot programs with customers in the architecture market."

In the days since we went to press with the story below, Brown CS alums Dave Simons ’90 and Daniel Wilk ’92 have won yet another award for their work on Adobe Character Animator. The National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences has recognized the tool as a Pioneering System for Live Performance-Based Animation Using Facial Recognition. Developed by Dave’s team, Character Animator allows artists to animate characters in real time via live tracking and has changed the landscape of character animation. “We are honored to work on software that allows artists to tell their stories in new ways,” says Dave when asked about his motivations for the project. The tool was used for the first-ever live episode of The Simpsons, live cartoon interviews on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, and the quick-turnaround production of Our Cartoon President, and will undoubtedly continue to make waves in the animation industry. “We knew the odds were against us,” laughs Brown CS alum Dave Simons ’90, “but the idealism of four recent college graduates trumped the 90% failure rate we were warned about.” Nearly 30 years later, it seems this idealism may not have been misplaced, as Dave, along with fellow Brown CS alums Daniel Wilk ’92 and Michael Natkin ’89, have just won an Academy Award in scientific and technical achievement for their work on Adobe After Effects. Awarded to those who provide extraordinary contributions to the science of filmmaking and a proven record of contributing significant value to the process of making motion pictures, the honor truly recognized the critical role that After Effects has come to play in the motion graphics industry. What motivated Dave to begin his work on this pioneering project? Well, it all started in the graphics group of Brown CS Professor Andy van Dam many years ago, at a time when undergraduate contributions to research were far less common. (Michael also mentioned both Andy and his group in his acceptance speech, thanking van Dam for "giving me a chance" and a first introduction to graphics.) “When I first began my work in this field, all the tools were command-line tools,” explains Dave, “and I actually did my senior thesis on distribution ray-tracing.” Friendships at Brown naturally led to the birth of The Company of Science & Art, otherwise known as CoSA for short. Founded by Dave and three other Brown graduates in June of 1990 –Greg Deocampo ’88, David Foster (DaveF) ’90, and David Herbstman (DaveH) ’90– the company planned to become the next world-class content provider for the new electronic age. “After searching all around Providence, DaveF found a great place near downtown,” he remembers. “DaveH negotiated the rent down to $1000 a month, and we were in business.” With such lofty expectations, it was no surprise that the fledgling company inevitably faced a myriad of setbacks in its early years. The original plan was to have artists and programmers working side by side to produce multimedia content, and CD-ROM production was the first task. Named Connections: The CoSA Journal, this first hypermedia publication was designed to show off the new medium, but garnered little interest. This was followed by PACo (PICS Animation Compiler), which allowed platform-independent low-bandwidth streaming animation playback with synched sound. What initially seemed like a promising idea, however, quickly changed as Apple announced QuickTime a mere few months later. Running low on funds, the team knew that they needed to come up with something fast. And it was from this that Egg (the first codename for After Effects) was born. This is where Dave’s graphics-group training would really start to pay off. With Egg development in full swing, it was at this point that Dan Wilk ’92 joined the team, helping to write effect plug-ins. The first press demos of the brand-new software were held in a private suite at MacWorld Boston. After receiving positive reviews from the public, the team quickly realized that the project needed a real name – After Effects. “Showing After Effects 1.0 to the public for the first time was an exhilarating experience,” remembers Dave, “We had a tiny booth and people were packed ten-deep at times trying to get a glimpse.” The software exploded in popularity, and CoSA was bought out a mere six months later by Aldus Corporation, followed by another merger of Aldus into Adobe Systems a year later. This set into motion the chain of events that led to After Effects becoming the dominant motion graphics and visual effects application used in the post-production process of film and television production. “It’s easily the most common tool now to do motion graphics in the film industry,” explains Dave, “and it really lets you create anything you want in this field.” Brown CS has certainly left its mark on the industry, as over 15 Brown graduates worked at CoSA or were involved in the After Effects project. Used for most of the iconic Pixar movies’ opening and closing credits, After Effects has quickly become an indispensable tool in the artist’s toolkit. With such an accomplished career, what does Dave believe prepared him best from his years at Brown? Well, it may very well have been his experiences TAing a myriad of classes in Brown CS. “I was a head TA for Andy van Dam in CS 11 and CS 192,” he remembers, “and Andy’s high bar and criticalness made me learn a lot.” Dave has certainly come a long way from the old, refurbished apartment in which the project first began, and his work has undoubtedly made it possible for countless artists to enable their dreams.

The results obtained by analyzing only a random sample of thedataset are an approximation of the exact solution. When onlya single value must be computed, the trade-off between the size of thesample and the accuracy of the approximation can be studied throughprobabilistic bounds (e.g., the Chernoff-Hoeffding bounds) for thedeviation of the quantity of interest in the sample from its exactvalue in the dataset. In many classical data mining problems, thenumber of quantities of interest can be extremely large (e.g.,betweenness centrality requires to compute one value for each node in agraph). In these cases, uniform (i.e., simultaneous) bounds to thedeviations of all quantities are needed. Classical techniques likethe Union bound are insufficient because excessively loose due totheir worst-case assumptions that do not hold in many data miningproblems. Rademacher Averages and theVapnik-Chervonenkis dimension have been developed to overcome this issue: they obtain much stricteruniform deviation bounds by taking into account the nature of theproblem and properties of the dataset and of the sampling process. Theyhave been used with success in the analysis of sampling algorithms fordata and graph analysis problems on very large datasets. In this tutorial, we survey the use ofRademacher Averages and VC-dimension for developing sampling-basedalgorithms for graph analysis and pattern mining. We start fromtheir theoretical foundations at the core of machine learning theory , thenshow a generic recipe for formulating data mining problems in a way thatallows using these concepts in the analysis of efficient randomizedalgorithms for those problems. Finally, we show examples of theapplication of this recipe to graph problems (connectivity, shortestpaths, betweenness centrality) and pattern mining . Our goal is to show how these techniques can be avaluable addition to the toolkit of the data mining researcher, and toencourage further research in the area.

Goldwater Scholar Posted by Rujul Singh on April 13, 2020 Click the links that follow for more news about Nishanth Kumar and other recent accomplishments by Brown CS students and researchers . Brown University undergraduate Nishanth Kumar, a Computer Engineering concentrator and Brown CS researcher, has recently received the Barry Goldwater Scholarship for his research into Learning from Demonstration (LfD). The scholarship was established by Congress in 1986 to identify and support the next generation of research leaders, and is widely regarded as one of the most prestigious undergraduate scholarships in the natural sciences, mathematics, and engineering in America. Nishanth joins fellow Brown students Adam Tropper (Physics and Astronomy concentrator) and Lucas Sanchez (Chemistry concentrator) this year as a scholarship recipient. Nishanth’s research focuses on teaching robots to learn real-world skills directly from observing demonstrations. “LfD allows non-expert operators to program skills simply by demonstrating them many times,” he explains, “and these learned skills are more general: they are able to handle slight variations of a task, such as if an object to be placed is slightly misplaced.” The issue with current LfD techniques, however, is that they train skills that are unable to target specific goals from many possible choices (i.e. targeting a specific button within a grid) without copious amounts of training data. “To combat this issue, I helped propose a method that learns skills that are parameterized by a goal parameter,” Nishanth says, “such that altering this parameter correctly alters the skill. In the button pressing scenario, instead of training a new skill for each button, we train one general skill that adapts itself depending on where the button is.” Looking forward, Nishanth is ready to continue solving some of the most practical problems in Artificial Intelligence: “After winning the scholarship, I’ve felt a deep responsibility and motivation to continue my research into AI and robotics. I believe the advent of intelligent, collaborative robots can massively change the world for the better and I hope to play some part in making this dream a reality.” For more information, click the link that follows to contact Brown CS Communications Outreach Specialist Jesse Polhemus.Awards Categories Awards (                                        194 articles                                    ) Diversity (                                        11 articles                                    ) Socially Responsible Computing (                                        4 articles                                    ) David Abel Wins A Presidential Award For Excellence In Teaching Posted by Rujul Singh on May 20, 2019 in Awards Click the links that follow for more news items about David Abel , other winners of the Presidential Award , and other awards won by our students. PhD candidate David Abel of Brown CS , who just recently proposed his thesis and expects to graduate with a PhD in Computer Science and a Master’s in Philosophy next spring, has been recognized for an accomplishment beyond his achievements in research. Chosen out of hundreds of graduate students with teaching appointments, Dave was one of only four to win the Presidential Award for Excellence in Teaching. The award, given annually at the University Awards ceremony, recognizes outstanding pedagogical achievement. Its criteria span from teaching that influences and inspires students to learn to development of curriculum and resources that promote student learning. Dave began his teaching journey in 2014 as a TA for Stefanie Tellex, teaching CS 1410 (an undergraduate Artificial Intelligence class). After being nominated as a “great TA” by the students in the class, he became a TA for CS 8 (A First Byte of Computer Science), an introductory computer science class for non-majors taught by Professor Michael Littman with enrollment of 109 students. During his semester of teaching the course, Dave was consistently praised by his students, with many citing his “energy, availability, and thoughtfulness” as being key to fostering an environment for intellectual curiosity. Dave was instrumental in implementing an optional python unit in the class that gave students the opportunity to learn a language used widely in industry. As a testament to his teaching abilities, a full 98.5% of respondents rated the class as effective or very effective when Michael took a sabbatical and Dave ran the class on his own. Not limited to the classroom, Dave has been involved in a variety of activities that may very well have had an even greater impact on the Brown community. Along with fellow CS PhD students Nediyana Daskalova and Amariah Becker, Dave has been heavily involved in designing and running peer mentorship program in the department. His initiative pairs up post-candidacy PhD students with first year PhD students, ensuring that new students have proper guidance regarding finding research, working with their advisor, and establishing work-life balance. Keeping with the spirit of mentorship, Dave has been a primary research advisor for several Brown undergraduates as well. Over the past few years, he has co-authored 11 papers with many undergraduate students, guiding them through the research process. Dave has clearly shown himself to be a remarkable teacher, both in and outside the classroom. As he finishes up his graduate studies, it's evident that his work has made a personal impact on the many dozens of students with whom he has worked.

Every year, Brown University 's Graduate School recognizes four students who are receiving doctoral degrees for superior achievements in research: one each in the humanities, life sciences, physical sciences, and social sciences. This year, one of the recipients of the Joukowsky Family Foundation Outstanding Dissertation Award is Evgenios Kornaropoulos of Brown CS , who successfully defended his thesis two weeks ago. He is the Department of Computer Science's second winner of this prestigious award, following Stefan Roth . The award and an honorarium will be given out at the Graduate School Commencement ceremony on Sunday, May 26. "As the volume and complexity of generated data grow," Evgenios explains, "users would like to maintain the ability to issue expressive queries on their data without sacrificing privacy. Encrypted databases are one of the most promising approaches towards this direction. However, this efficiency comes with the price of leaking information about the plaintext data. In my thesis, we use an algorithmic approach to develop rigorous attacks on encrypted databases and secure protocols." Specifically, Evgenios's work addresses the limitation of standard leakage profiles in encrypted databases under widely-used expressive queries such as range queries and k-nearest neighbor queries. "In the works published from my thesis," he says, "we show that even though we have cryptographic proofs that guarantee that the interaction between a client and a server leaks nothing more than a well-defined piece of information, we are still discovering what an adversary can infer from the leaked information. Using a plethora of algorithmic tools from areas such as computational geometry, statistics, learning theory, probabilistic analysis, and optimization, we devise new attacks that recover the plaintext values of encrypted databases under minimal assumptions about the query and the data distribution. Hopefully, our findings will pave the way towards new efficient cryptographic designs that defend against our attacks." When asked about the experience of doing a PhD at Brown CS, Evgenios says, "I am thrilled to call Prof. Roberto Tamassia my academic father. His experience, rigor, and patience helped me sharpen my technical skills as well as my research taste. I also feel very fortunate to interact frequently with our professors that lead by example such as Prof. Vasileios Kemerlis and the rest of our Security Group . Finally, a big part of my thesis came out of my interaction with my academic sibling Prof. Charalampos Papamanthou from University of Maryland who is doing outstanding research and always sets the bar high. It is an honor to receive this prestigious award from our Graduate School and I am thankful for our professors and staff for making my graduate studies such a rewarding experience!"

Likeearlier free online course offerings, e.g., MIT's OCW (Open CourseWare)initiative, they provide resources such as videos, recommended readings, and problemsets.  They differ from these earlieronline courses in two major ways: the courses are designed for online useinstead of being copies of on-site existing courses, and they are structuredaround interactive social networks, called user forums. Currently there are three major MOOCvendors: Coursera (www.coursera.org), edX (www.edx.org), and Udacity(www.udacity.com).  While the format forthe three is similar, Udacity differs from Coursera and edX in that it does nothave a calendar-based schedule; students may start a course at any time. The figure below fromStanford (http://www.stanforddaily.com/2013/02/05/a-look-at-online-education-coursera-edx-and-udacity/online-education-page-1/) summarizes keycomponents: history, number of universities, number of courses, number ofstudents, and whether they are for-profit or non-profit.Awards Categories Awards (                                        194 articles                                    ) Diversity (                                        11 articles                                    ) Socially Responsible Computing (                                        4 articles                                    ) Brown CS Alum Guillaume Marceau And Professors Fisler And Krishnamurthi Win The Onward! 2011 Most Notable Paper Award Posted by Eli Pullaro on Dec. 20, 2021 in Awards Click the links that follow for more news about Kathi Fisler , Guillaume Marceau , Shriram Krishnamurthi , and other recent accomplishments by our faculty and alums . Brown CS alum Guillaume Marceau, Professor Kathi Fisler , and Professor Shriram Krishnamurthi have just received the Onward! 2011 Most Notable Paper Award. This honor is given annually to the authors of a paper that was presented at the Onward! conference, an international event focusing on everything to do with programming and software. The papers are judged based on the influence they have had and their impact over the last ten years. The paper, “Mind Your Language: On Novices' Interactions with Error Messages,” explored beginning students’ reaction to error messages. Error messages can provide guidance to programmers while working and at the same time frustrate them because of the difficulty that comes with deciphering these messages. Using the programming language DrRacket, the paper studied how students respond to the vocabulary used in error messages. The paper found several problems with the understandability of messages, and presented  recommendations to language developers and educators that have since had a significant impact on error message presentation.  The paper was originally inspired by a “talk-aloud study” and in particular, one student’s remark on the confusing error messages they inevitably come across. Guillaume, Kathi, and Shriram’s research on error messages offered valuable insights into “one of the most critical user experience elements for programmers,” according to their paper.

This week, Professor Eli Upfal of Brown CS and his collaborators received one of theoretical computer science's highest honors, an award that also pays tribute to Eli's predecessor at Brown University . Together with Yossi Azar (Tel Aviv University), Andrei Broder (Google Research), Anna Karlin (University of Washington), and Michael Mitzenmacher (Harvard University), Upfal has won the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Paris Kanellakis Theory and Practice Award for the discovery and analysis of balanced allocations, known as the power of two choices, and their extensive applications to practice. The ACM is the world's largest educational and scientific computing society, and Eli is the first Brown CS recipient of this accolade, which is given annually to recognize specific theoretical accomplishments that have had a significant and demonstrable effect on the practice of computing. It's accompanied by a prize of $10,000. In a 1994 paper , Eli and his colleagues introduced the balanced allocations framework, also known as the power of two choices paradigm, a theoretical work that has had widespread practical impact. It can be explained as follows: when n balls are thrown into n bins chosen uniformly at random, it's known with high probability that the maximum load on any bin is bounded by (lg n/lg lg n) (1+o(1)). The researchers proved that adding a little bit of choice makes a big difference. When throwing each ball, instead of choosing one bin at random, the thrower should choose two bins at random, then place the ball in the bin with the lesser load. This minor change brings an exponential improvement: now, with high probability, the maximal load in any bin is bounded by (lg lg n/lg 2)+O(1). In the same work, they show that if each ball has d choices, the maximum load drops with high probability to (ln ln n/ ln d)+O(1). Since bins and balls are the basic model for analyzing data structures such as hashing or processes like load balancing of jobs in servers, it's not surprising that the power of two choices, which requires only a local decision rather than global coordination, has led to a wide range of practical applications. Just a few examples include Google's web index, Akamai’s overlay routing network, and highly reliable distributed data storage systems used by Microsoft and Dropbox, all based on variants of the power of two choices paradigm. "The Balanced Allocations paper and the follow-up work on the power of two choices," the ACM writes, "are elegant theoretical results, and their content had, and will surely continue to have, a demonstrable effect on the practice of computing." Paris Kanellakis was a distinguished computer scientist who was an esteemed and beloved member of the Brown CS community. His research area was theoretical computer science, with emphasis on the principles of database systems, logic in computer science, the principles of distributed computing, and combinatorial optimization. "Winning this award is special for me," says Eli. "I've always been proud to be Paris's successor at Brown, and being recognized as someone who has had a similar impact on computing practice is really an honor. Bringing an award named for Paris Kanellakis back to Brown feels like closing a circle." The full ACM press release is available here .

The Association for the Advancement for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) is a nonprofit scientific society devoted to advancing the scientific understanding of the mechanisms underlying thought and intelligent behavior and their embodiment in machines, and ACM SIGAI is the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Artificial Intelligence. Working in concert, they present the Joint AAAI/ACM SIGAI Doctoral Dissertation Award annually to recognize and encourage superior research and writing by doctoral candidates in artificial intelligence, and Brown CS alum David Abel has just been announced as one of only two runners-up for the 2020 prize. Advised by Brown CS Professor Michael Littman , David's thesis (" A Theory of Abstraction in Reinforcement Learning ") explores the use of abstraction to reduce the complexity of effective reinforcement learning. "Reinforcement learning," he explains, "defines the problem facing agents that learn to make good decisions through action and observation alone. To be effective problem solvers, such agents must efficiently explore vast worlds, assign credit from delayed feedback, and generalize to new experiences, all while making use of limited data, computational resources, and perceptual bandwidth. Abstraction is essential to all of these endeavors. Through abstraction, agents can form concise models of their environment that support the many practices required of a rational, adaptive decision maker." In his dissertation, David starts with three desiderata for functions that carry out the process of abstraction: they should preserve representation of near-optimal behavior, be learned and constructed efficiently, and lower planning or learning time. Abel then presents a suite of new algorithms and analysis that clarify how agents can learn to abstract according to these desiderata. Collectively, he says, these results provide a partial path toward the discovery and use of abstraction that minimizes the complexity of effective reinforcement learning.

But transportation systems do not work for free: each of the millions of passengers they serve must pay for their rides. Let's take a look at their underlying payment systems. The simplest, and oldest, payment system is with actual cash, tokens, or tickets. One of its advantages is that the passengers do not leave behind an electronic trail of their comings and goings. However, it also has severe limitations: physical payments require cashiers or customized payment booths or turnstiles; it is hard to adapt the system to variable pricing or to collect statistics that lead to better services, As a result, pre-paid or monthly cards (those that need to be swiped, or sometimes contactless cards) such as MetroCards in NYC and Charlie Cards in Boston have replaced the physical tokens. Contactless devices have also made paying highway tolls easier: systems such as E-ZPass give drivers a device that automatically pays their tolls as they drive through the toll booth. These convenient systems raise concerns about the privacy of their customers. One’s MetroCard or Charlie Card is a persistent identiﬁer, and the MTA in New York, or MBTA in Boston, has the ability to locate an individual in a large metropolis based on where they’ve used their card. These devices do not necessarily offer security for the transportation authorities either — for example, the Charlie Card was shown vulnerable to forgery by three MIT students doing a class project. Thus, current practices are the worst of both worlds since there are no guarantees for either private or secure payments. One may argue that giving up one’s privacy is a small price to pay for such important beneﬁts as ease and convenience, not to mention the fact that the information collected can facilitate advanced traveler information dissemination, trafﬁc management, travel time estimation, emergency management, congestion pricing, carbon emissions control, and environmental justice assessments. But is it possible to get the best of both worlds? Can we get the ease and convenience of Metrocards  as well as the benefits of data collection without sacrificing privacy? In theory, there exist cryptographic techniques that make this possible. Electronic cash schemes (e-cash) have all the privacy beneﬁts of actual physical cash. But how can we implement them on constrained devices such as a MetroCard? How do we make them work with the same speed and convenience as non-privacy-preserving MetroCards? How do we preserve the ability to collect the same useful information about trafﬁc patterns, without sacrificing the privacy of individuals? Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) is a multi-disciplinary research project funded by the NSF 1 that started in 2010 and seeks to answer these questions. The project includes a diverse team of computer scientists, cryptographers, electrical and computer engineers, and transportation systems researchers from Brown University and the University of Massachusetts. The goal of PAYG is to bridge the gap between theoretical constructions and practical implementations on RFID devices. Starting on the crypto side, we want to construct efficient and provable secure e-cash schemes. On the other end, we want to achieve highly efﬁcient implementations of e-cash in RFID devices that would be appropriate for the transportation scenario. Working from both ends of the problem, the goal of PAYG is to obtain a solution that offers speed and convenience on the one hand, and cryptographic guarantees of security and privacy on the other. By incorporating additional cryptographic techniques, we can derive additional beneﬁts, such as variable pricing and privacy-preserving data collection. The results of the PAYG project are very promising! On the crypto end we managed to construct a new e-cash scheme [1], to be presented at ACM-CCS 2013, that perfectly suits the purpose of payments in public transportation systems. It is very efficient, has a formal proof of security, and allows the encoding of a user’s attributes (such as age, address, etc.) on the coins/tokens withdrawn which is essential for the transportation setting. Encoding users’ attributes in the coins/tokens allows us to implement additional features in our system such as variable pricing (e.g. reduced fare for senior customers) and privacy-preserving data collection. Our new e-cash scheme is a very exciting development in the e-cash research: previous schemes were either not provably secure or too computationally expensive for scenarios where lightweight devices are used and efficiency is crucial. On the implementation end, the biggest challenge is the processing time constraints of transportation payment systems. To avoid congestion in front of turnstiles, a payment transaction should take approximately 300 ms which is a considerable challenge given the computational complexity of advanced payment protocols. The efﬁciency of loading money on one’s payment device is less critical but should also not take longer than a few seconds. Another set of challenges are related to the payment device itself. First, it should be based on inexpensive hardware due to the potentially very high volume and the need to replace payment cards frequently. Second, it should be able to communicate and work contactlessly and without a battery. These two conditions are seemingly in conﬂict with the need to run very complex cryptographic operations. The results of the PAYG project on the implementation side are also very encouraging. In a work that was recently presented at Privacy Enhancing Technology Symposium (PETS’13) we implemented our new e-cash scheme using an NFC enabled smartphone [2]. We managed to take advantage of certain elements of the smartphone’s API in order to speed up our implementation. We implemented loading  in 300 milliseconds (including terminal, communication and smartphone execution time) and payment in about 380 milliseconds (when two attributes are revealed; less if no attributes were revealed). In conclusion, our work on the PAYG project shows that private and cryptographically secure payments in public transportation systems are a practical possibility. We managed to use cryptographic techniques that were previously considered prohibitively inefficient for such an application. But, are transportation systems the only possible application area of our results? How can we extend our results to be used in other scenarios where private and efficient transactions are required? ----------------------------------- ^1: NSF grant numbers: 096464, 0964379.

Founded in 1971, the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM) aims to create a community in which women and girls can thrive in their mathematical endeavors, and to promote equitable opportunity and treatment of women and others of marginalized genders and gender identities across the mathematical sciences. Almost twenty-five years ago, they established the Alice T. Schafer Mathematics Prize , named for one of their founding members, to be awarded to an undergraduate woman for excellence in mathematics. This year, Brown CS student Mattie Ji , a senior majoring in Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, and Computer Science, was the prize's runner-up. Mattie describes her interests as wide, and her knowledge of algebraic geometry and topology has allowed her participation in several Research Experience for Undergraduates programs where she contributed to projects that included an investigation into the relationship between the concepts of Euler characteristic transform (ECT) and smooth ECT, fake projective planes, and the study of a class of conic bundle threefolds. She has a keen interest in coding complex problems and has a repository set up on GitHub displaying her work . "[Mattie] is consistently described," the AWM writes, "as an outstanding student with the initiative to develop her knowledge and understanding and has an infectious passion for mathematics, with a remarkable record of co-authored papers and conference presentations." "While this is an award in mathematics," Mattie says, "I would not have gotten this award without the education and experience I have had within the Department of Computer Science. Many of my research projects that helped me garner this award involved various aspects of computational and data science, and I believe that my background and education in Computer Science were very critical for this award."

The book is 1209 pages, which is slightly shorter than the second edition, but it's in a larger format, which more than compensates for the difference. Several topics (the extensive discussion of user interfaces, the long chapters on spline curves and surfaces) have been substantially trimmed down, since there are now whole fields (computer-human interaction, computer-aided design) in which these topics find their natural home. The discussion of rendering -- especially Monte Carlo methods -- has been enlarged a good deal. There's a big Brown CS representation in the book -- Andy van Dam and I here at Brown, my former Ph.D. student Morgan McGuire of Williams, former adjunct faculty member David Sklar of Vizify, Andy's former Ph.D. student Steve Feiner of Columbia -- along with Jim Foley of Georgia Tech and Kurt Akeley of Lytro. As the lead author on this edition, I'm (a) exhausted, and (b) very happy with the final product. The text is almost entirely new, although it's strongly influenced, of course, by the presentation and order of the earlier editions. What's Different? Hardware by a world expert The third edition contains a chapter on Modern Graphics Hardware by Kurt Akeley, the cofounder of Silicon Graphics, designer of the Reality Engine and GL/OpenGL, and now CTO of Lytro. Kurt uses a recent NVIDIA GPU as a model for analyzing the tradeoffs involved in designing a graphics processor, including the cost/benefit choices involved in parallelizing graphics tasks, and extensive discussion of memory, concentrating on locality of reference and its relationship to caching, and the consequences of the differing constants in the Moore's-Law-like improvements in memory, computation, and bandwidth.  He also discusses the tradeoff between implementation simplicity and power provided to the user, and identifies a principle --- The art of architecture design includes identifying conflicts between the interests of implementors and users, and making the best tradeoffs --- early in the chapter, and then illustrates it with numerous examples. Principles galore That design tradeoff principle illustrates something about the book as well: as we designed and revised chapters, we found ourselves repeatedly explaining a single idea in multiple contexts, and began to extract principles that we've found ourselves using over the years. These principles range over many levels of detail. The "average height principle" says that the average height of a point on the upper hemisphere of the unit sphere is 1/2, for example. That seems pretty specific, but it's remarkable how often it comes up in discussing rendering topics. At the other extreme, the "meaning principle" --- which says that for every number that appears in a graphics program, you need to know the semantics, the meaning, of that number --- applies very widely. This principle might seem completely obvious to you -- of course you need to know what numbers mean! If you're thinking that, let me ask you this: suppose the top left pixel of your color image has colors (r, g, b) = (245, 13, 11). What does that "245" mean? If you think the pixel values are describing light as a physical phenomenon, what are the units? Writing a book in a new century The world’s changed a lot since our last edition. Students are used to grabbing code from the internet. The language of choice has changed from Pascal and/or C to … well, to what? C++? Scheme? Java? C#? Haskell? OCaml? The great thing is that it doesn’t really matter. If you want to learn about, say, ray-intersect-plane computations, you can probably find implementations in any of those languages. That meant two things for us as authors: • We don’t actually have to include code for many algorithms. The student can grab code from the web in whatever language works best for him or her. • When we do write code, we can feel free to do it in almost any language. In the book, there’s C, C++, C#, GLSL, pseudocode, and possibly some others I’ve forgotten. The C-like languages are all similar enough that a student who knows one can generally read the others. Much of the early part of the book introduces 2D and basic 3D graphics via Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), a graphics library accessible through an XML-like format and via C# code, but essentially the same ideas are usable via other libraries. These two mean that if the main ideas are explained simply and clearly enough – which is, after all, our strength – then the student can make the most of them. Structure The second edition started with 2D graphics in great detail, including extensive coverage of low-level topics like scan-conversion. Since the modern version of scan-conversion, rasterization, is now generally done in the GPU, it’s no longer the central topic it once was. It’s also usually based on spatial subdivision approaches, which are most naturally delayed until later in the book. In the new edition, we’ve taken a different approach, briefly describing in the first chapter many of the main ideas of graphics, which are then treated in successively greater detail and mathematical sophistication in multiple later chapters. A clock modeled in WPF in Chapter 2 The Durer engraving used in Chapter 3 Pictures early! We start with WPF’s 2D features, which gives students a chance to make pictures – indeed animated pictures – in the second chapter, and learn about hierarchical modeling as they build a model of a clock-face. This same 2D foundation is used, in Chapter 3, to produce output for a very basic raytracer based on the famous Durer etching shown above. Almost immediately the student then learns about WPF 3D, and its basic Blinn-Phong shading model, after which we describe a couple of test-bed programs in WPF that the student can use to perform exercises throughout the book. Onion peeling At the end of the introduction we lay out a few basic facts about light, a little mathematics, and something about representation of shape in graphics – just enough to let a student make a first renderer. As we work through the first several chapters, topics like clipping and transformations arise naturally, and efficiency considerations lead to discussion of how best to represent shapes with meshes. A few chapters further along, we revisit many of these ideas with greater sophistication. Morgan McGuire provides a wonderful mid-book chapter that summarizes the main current representations of light, of shape, and of light-transport, covering each in enough detail to let the student begin to see the big picture of how efficiency in one area may complicate another, etc. It’s the most “computer-sciency” chapter the students have seen at this point. It goes into detail on fixed- and floating-point representations of numbers, memory structure in Z-buffers (and other buffers), precomputation and caching for geometric models, etc.  The next chapter puts much of this information to use in building a slightly more sophisticated (but not recursive) raytracer, a rasterizing renderer, and a hardware-based renderer, and showing how the three produce identical results, thus emphasizing the critical difference between raytracing and rasterization in the reordering of two main loops, and the consequences this has on caching, memory access patterns, etc. In later chapters, we return to raytracing in its recursive form, together with more sophisticated scattering models for light-surface interaction, and develop a path-tracer and photon-mapping renderer. And in the final chapter, on graphics hardware, we return to hardware-based rendering. This repeated treatment of the same topic allows the student to develop sophistication before facing the full complexities of the topic in its greatest generality. It also lets a teacher select how deeply to address a topic by including some chapters in the syllabus and omitting others. The Fourier transform of a box is a sinc Extramaterial Another feature of writing a book in the internet age isthat we can provide lots more to our readers. We’re working on releasing sourcecode for many of the illustrations in the book, many of which (like the oneillustrating that the Fourier transform of a box-filter is a sinc-function,shamelessly adapted from Bracewell’s Fourier Analysis book) were generated byprograms in Matlab and other environments. We also provide example programs for download, and the basic ideas inWPF are explained using “Browser Apps” (created by David Sklar) in which thestudent can edit, in a browser, WPF2D XAML code and get instant feedback on theresults without every installing any software on his/her computer at all.

The Computing Research Association (CRA) is a coalition of more than 200 organizations with the mission of enhancing innovation by joining with industry, government, and academia to strengthen research and advance education in computing. Every year, they recognize North American students who show phenomenal research potential with their Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Award, and for 2023-2024, four Brown CS students received honors: Megan Frisella (Finalist) and Anh Truong, Qiuhong Anna Wei, and Carolyn Zech (Honorable Mention). Megan Frisella “My main research project,” Megan says, “is about soft memory, a new form of flexible memory that helps increase server utilization in datacenters. The work is done in the ETOS group under the advising of [Assistant Professor] Malte Schwarzkopf . Traditional memory is inflexible: once memory is allocated to an application, it cannot be reallocated until the application terminates or explicitly frees it. This incentivizes datacenter operators to evict low-priority jobs and run at low memory utilization. Soft memory is a software level abstraction on top of DRAM that makes memory revocable under memory pressure, for reallocation elsewhere. Our system avoids out-of-memory terminations because soft memory can always be reclaimed from an application to fulfill a request elsewhere. We published a paper on Soft Memory at HotOS 2023 . In addition to systems research, I am also interested in programming languages. Last summer, I joined the RiSE group at Microsoft Research where I worked on a domain-specific language in F*, called Pulse, for proof-oriented imperative programming. While most proof-oriented languages are functional, Pulse enables developers to write programs with proofs in a Rust-like syntax. Pulse extends F* with proof automation, custom proof syntax, and imperative programming paradigms like loops. We have a Pulse tutorial in POPL 2024 TutorialFest .” Anh Truong “My research,” Anh tells us, “lies at the intersection of computer graphics and machine learning. I've been working on a project with [Eliot Horowitz Assistant Professor of Computer Science] Daniel Ritchie that aims to achieve few-shot synthesis of 3D shapes: our goal is to help novice users easily generate novel 3D models which borrow geometric features from a small set of example models they may have readily available. Such a system could allow designers to easily populate virtual worlds with varied geometry or iterate by generating many candidate models from which the most desirable can be expanded upon. A highlight of the project for me has been exploring the interface between geometry processing and machine learning and seeing how creatively ideas from these two (seemingly unrelated) fields have mingled. I am immensely grateful to have been able to work with Daniel and my wonderful labmates, and I look forward to exploring much more of computer graphics.” Qiuhong Anna Wei Anna’s research, she explains, centers around building visual reasoning methods and making technology more trustworthy. “I’ve been working,” she says, “with [Assistant Professor] Srinath Sridhar at Brown IVL and Professor Leonidas Guibas from Stanford University on 3D vision and learning, specifically canonicalization of collections of objects, in the setting of indoor furniture rearrangement when given relatively extensive or limited information. I’ve also worked with Daniel Ritchie recently in exploring the differences and similarities in human and machine understanding of layouts and ‘regularity’, as part of a larger project on open-universe scene generation with LLM program synthesis. On the other front, I have been working with [Assistant Professor] Peihan Miao and [James A. and Julie N. Brown Professor of Computer Science] Anna Lysyanskaya on private computing on set intersection in cryptography. We’re especially interested in how the key component, oblivious shuffle realized via switching networks, may be optimized to achieve better efficiency or adapted to different frameworks or security settings.” Carolyn Zech “Paralegal,” Carolyn explains, “is a static analyzer that verifies Rust applications for compliance with user-specified policies. If an application fails to abide by a policy, Paralegal identifies the problematic code segment(s). Developers leverage Paralegal to prevent vulnerabilities from reaching production. Currently, developers write their Paralegal policies as graph queries, which makes policy-writing laborious and error-prone. My research focuses on developing a natural language interface for Paralegal, so that developers can specify high-level, intuitive policies (for example, ‘all users are authorized before accessing application data’) and receive quick notification of whether their code is compliant.” Anh, Anna, Carolyn, and Megan join numerous prior Brown CS recipients of Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Award honors. Most recently, they include Rachel Ma (Honorable Mention, 2022) , Jiaju Ma (Finalist, 2021), Wasu Piriyakulkij (Honorable Mention, 2021), Nitya Thakkar (Honorable Mention, 2021) , Sarah Bawabe (Honorable Mention, 2020), Nishanth Kumar (Finalist, 2020), Dylan Sam (Honorable Mention, 2020), and Homer Walke (Honorable Mention, 2020) .

Coursera courses provide, in addition to all ofthis, a focus on interaction among all participants that pervades the structureand experience of the course. UserForums: These are the primary mechanism through which students interactwith each other, the community TAs, and the professor(s). They provide a chanceto ask questions and engage interactively with the answers. In addition, forumusers frequently volunteer their expertise by recommending resources andproviding insights that can be both surprising and very helpful. This is thekey difference between the Coursera student experience and the experience ofwatching videos in other, non-interactive online courses:  MIT-OCW and Stanford Video lectures provide nointeraction, no community, while Khan Academy, with its very different focusand granularity, has some minor interactive responses to specific videos.Coursera's user forums are relevant to the entire course and comprise manythousands of highly engaged participants. In the beginning I was interested just in the videos andtended to ignore the forums, feeling I didn't want to waste my time with othersas ignorant as I. However, I found that I was very, very mistaken: the Courseraforums have become a resource that is unique in my experience and has providedboth guidance and enriching ongoing dialogue/debate I've never beforeexperienced. Some forum members have become friends with whom I continue to expandmy understanding. StudyGroups: These provide a second interaction mechanism, and may be online anddistributed or co-located. At the beginning of each course students arestrongly encouraged to form study groups based on whatever criteria they findcongenial. The study groups become in effect small cohesive communities whereideas are explored in a safe space and people get to know each other. Again,initially I scorned the study groups, thinking I preferred to work things outon my own, and again I was wrong. This time around, in Keith Devlin'sIntroduction to Mathematical Thinking, the study group I've formed with afriend who is also taking the course is turning out to be enormously helpful: heand I debate our differing reasons for assignment answers, egg each other on tosupport our positions, and uncover new resources, which we then post to theforum. PeerReview: This is a third form of interaction, one which — justifiably in myopinion —is very controversial. My experience is that while doing a peer review is quite valuable inthe same way that attempting to teach is a very powerful way to learn, peerreview responses are not so useful. My opinion was unfortunately reinforcedearly on by a disastrous experience with idiotic peer reviews, or non-reviews,of an essay I'd spent a week researching and writing. However, engaging inrebuttal and the subsequent interactive dialogue is quite useful. ISSUES From my perspective as a student, themajor problems involve structural inadequacies in search, forums, andresources. Searches: The most critical defect in Coursera is the brain-dead search facility, whichis a simple string-only search over the titles and text of the forum. Youcannot search on the names of posters — e.g., you cannot find all posts by aparticular person — you cannot search the rest of the course site, and youcannot do simple Booleans such as "find this but not that", much lesstake advantage of regular expression patterns. Many subject-specific userforums use Google search, which while not perfect is much more useful than thecurrent Coursera search; Coursera should do the same. Searches should be faceted, e.g.,search on post author, date, ..., the scope should be the full course website, andthey should be able to be saved and then used for search refinements.  The same automatic visualization tools thatshould illustrate the evolving forum graph structure (see below) could be usedto visualize the results of searches and sub-searches. Structure/relationshipvisualization is a key tool in gaining deep understanding. ForumsStructure: Issues and possible solutions include the following points. 1. It is currently impossible to trackall threads. Forum software needs to automatically assign author-editable tagsto entries, and from that develop an emergent substructure among the threads.Threads should be sortable by tag, creation and modification date, author, andtitle. 2. The current structure is like arigid class hierarchy and needs cross-cutting views; it should be a graphstructure to reflect the emerging multiple POV (point-of-view)s and LOD(level-of-detail)s. 3. The community TAs need a tool fortraversing the forums effectively and adding intermediate structure as needed,beyond the automatic evolution suggested in Point 1. 4. There should be a topics forumthat is independent of lecture and assignment and could have automatic linksinto relevant lectures and other forum threads. Obviously, the topics forumneeds to evolve deep structure as the course proceeds. 5. An evolving linked visualizationof the interacting threads graph would be extremely valuable. The NSDL ScienceLiteracy Maps (http://strandmaps.nsdl.org/) illustrate one possibility.StrandMaps would be a great addition to the courses. In sum, what is needed is acombination of full-faceted search plus an evolving forum structure withmultiple points of view. Resources :In general, the resources are a fairly traditional set of lectures andrecommended readings. The videos I've seen tend to be straightforward, high-qualitylectures; the exception to this pattern is a modern poetry course with videos ofhour-long close reading discussions by the professor and several graduatestudents sitting around a conference table. However, in the courses I've takenso far there is no metalevel visualization of context, no use of 2D or 3Dvisualization of the dynamics of the material, much less the forum threads, noset of relationship graphs among themes, no real integration or connectionswith the larger domain. In short, there is no reference to or exploration ofthe ecology of which the subject is part. It is as if hypertext had never beeninvented. Finally, while forums can be a rich source of recommendations forbooks, people, and websites, they too lack this awareness of any larger frameof reference. STRATEGIES Whypeople take the courses: Reasons for taking the courses, which are especiallydiverse with Coursera due to its heterogeneity and interactivity, include: testingthe waters, curiosity, need for community, opportunity to get questionsanswered, and gaining perspective, as well as a serious intent to complete allthe material.Further, as theCoursera courses have progressed, professors are realizing that their targetaudience is primarily adults, often adults with many other obligations. Thus,the current tendency is to close a course to new enrollments at the end of thecourse but to keep it accessible to those who did enroll at least until thenext time the course is given.Prof.Devlin, for example, has decided to keep the fall 2012 site of his mathematicalthinking course open. It would be nice if Coursera established a policy ofkeeping the course materials on a persistent basis, like the MIT OCW, Stanfordvideo, and Khan Academy materials. Working with the forumsto counteract rigidity: As mentioned above, the forum structures are rigid,like a rigid class structure, and badly need cross-cutting and refactoringcapabilities. In the absence of facilities for doing this, I've developedworkaround strategies that help compensate for and manage the sometimesoverwhelming chaos of thousands of unstructured threads. First of all, from the beginning of a course in which I intendto be seriously involved, I take advantage of the forums' latest posts list onthe forum home page. This lets me track new threads of interest, as well asinteresting people and community TAs (remember that it is not possible tosearch on names). I then subscribe to threads that seem promising and capturecontent I want to save and work with on my local system. In addition, in the General Discussion forum I've establishedthreads for topics, experts, and resources I think are important and keep thesethreads foregrounded by periodically posting to them and providing links torelated forum posts I've discovered during my daily prowls of the forum. Search: Unfortunately, there is little that can be donewith the brain-dead search facility.  Afurther frustration is that when you subscribe to a thread and an email arriveswith a new post or comment, clicking on the link takes you not to the post butto the top of the thread, and because you can't search on the name of the poster,you are reduced to attempting to discover where the comment is coming from byeither scrolling down the thread or trying to enter a string from the commentinto the search engine. [1] Coursera is one of three major vendors of MOOC (Massive Open Online Course)courseware that have come to prominence in the last year.  Since I have direct experience with justCoursera, I have only referenced it in this article.  For a brief overview and comparison of threevendors - Coursera, EdX, and Udacity - see the article "MOOC vendors:  A Comparison Overview"Awards Categories Awards (                                        194 articles                                    ) Diversity (                                        11 articles                                    ) Socially Responsible Computing (                                        4 articles                                    ) John Hughes Ranks In The Top 0.21% Of Stack Exchange’s Math Users Posted by Robayet Hossain on Jan. 29, 2024 in Awards Click the links that follow for more news about John Hughes and other recent accomplishments by our faculty . Stack Exchange is a network of question-and-answer websites on subjects in diverse fields, with each site covering a specific topic where users’ questions and answers are input into an online reputation award process. Stack Exchange website areas include knitting, electronics, and especially programming, and users are able to upvote questions and answers that feel relevant and right for them. Brown CS faculty member John Hughes was recently ranked in the top 0.21% of Stack Exchange users in the Mathematics stack exchange for his reputation in answering questions posted online. “When someone upvotes the answer, you get 10 magical internet points that are of no value to anyone at all, except you get a little reputation, and when someone accepts your answer, you get 15 points,” John states. “Those of us who like explaining things and showing off how much we know often answer a couple questions on this website now and then.” Hughes explains that he would answer a few questions every morning as a way of practicing exposition and developing the skill of reading a question well enough to fully understand the users’ requests. He first became involved in the Stack Exchange network more than 10 years ago when he used the Computing stack exchange to ask questions regarding Windows for help in writing a graphics book, as well as the Electronics network to ask questions regarding characteristics of certain transistors. “The Math stack exchange appealed to me because I used to be a mathematician, and I still love doing it, and because there was a sweet spot between the number of questions and the number of answers,” John says. “If you go and find information about your Android phone on the Android stack exchange, there are 8 billion questions and most of them never get an answer, so the math site is much better about that.” “The thing I enjoy most is divided into two things: one is helping out someone where I think my help is actually useful to them. That’s very satisfying, knowing that someone is in need, and at the cost of asking them a few leading questions about the problem, I am able to get them on their way, and that is part of the reason why I like teaching,” John says. “The other thing I really enjoy is this business of learning to read questions carefully, learning to figure out what someone is asking and where they are confused.” When asked about his favorite experiences with answering a question, Hughes referenced a few fond memories. There was one case where a Stack Exchange question thread resulted in him writing a joint paper about combinatorics with the user that eventually was posted to arXiv and became useful for future users. “There are some things that aren’t worth doing financially; the free market isn’t going to make them happen. But if those are things that I like doing, I’ve gotta make them happen,” John says. “If you like going to parties, you’d better throw one now and then, and so part of public service for me is self-interest. I like talking about math with people, so I should contribute some time to that.” Hughes believes it is valuable for faculty members to have interesting sidelights such as he’s had throughout the last decade, telling a story of Brown’s old lecture series called Twisted Paths, where faculty in STEM gave talks about the diverse path they took to be doing what they are doing currently. “I think about my former colleague Tom Dean, who was hand-carving parts for furniture”, John says, adding that Dean became interested in selling refurbished metalworking machinery and started wondering about automatically controlling machines for this task, but did not have the necessary knowledge or money to delve into the work with these electronic parts. “That’s when his wife Jo discovered that the local community college had affordable classes that would give him the education he needed and from there, his career as a scientist got launched,” John says. “He ended up working on some really fascinating projects at Google, working towards mapping parts of real brains to understand how they worked. So that’s a pretty twisted path: a guy who was carving table-legs ends up being a top AI researcher.” John states that the most interesting scientists he has known have followed a very twisted path and that their former interests informed how they think about what they’re doing now. “There’s plenty of fuel out there in the world; there just aren’t enough sparks,” John says. “So I think of public service as one of the ways of being a spark, and that’s why I do it.” For more information, click the link that follows to contact Brown CS Communications Manager Jesse C.

This is a junior-, senior-, andbeginning-graduate-level course in programming languages (not in how toprogram, but rather in linguistic mechanisms). Together with my PhD student(and graduate TA) Joe Politz, I decided to offer it on-line in addition toin-class. My primarygoal was to understand this new teaching medium. As someone who runs veryinteractive classes and teaches solely by writing on a board, I had long beenconvinced that my teaching methods would simply never work with a remoteaudience. Having maintained this position for many years, I felt it importantto experiment and learn how to adapt: everyone of a certain age (or pop culturesensibility) recognizes the phrase, “video killed the radio star.” I did not do it for the reasons that thefounders of Coursera have proclaimed: that they had almost no studentengagement in their classes, they were tired of telling the same old jokes, andso on. One might conclude from their narrative that teaching and learning atStanford must be a terrible experience; though a more charitable (and much morelikely) reading is that they are exaggerating for corporate effect. Hype andexaggeration apart, I do believe higher education is at a potentially criticaljuncture. Against this backdrop, Brown is engaging in a large planning effort, investingsignificant energy and resources on campus space. We are fortunate to be havingthis discussion after the MOOC (Massive Open On-Line Course, the idea ofteaching courses through electronic media to large numbers of students—aspersonified by courses on Coursera, Udacity, EdX, and other organizations)phenomenon has begun; it would be unfortunate if it did not significantlyaffect these conversations, especially due to the impact on the classroom(which I think is likely to be enormous). THE ONLINE COURSE, AND BROWN'S VALUE ADDITION It was always clear that we could not offer exactly the samecourse as we gave Brown students. One of the important parts of my course is aset of open-ended written assignments. I consider these extremely important inmeasuring student understanding of the material, but we almost certainly lackedthe resources to grade them for the on-line students. Nor were we willing, asmany MOOCs are, to “grade” using simple computer-driven textual analysis; wewanted to read the responses in depth. Thus the courses differed, and we wereable to point to tangible differences—beyond the evident intangibles—betweenthe Brown and on-line offerings. CERTIFICATION LEVELS Because we were not offering Brown’s course in full, we werefree to customize our course to different on-line clientele. Instead of grades(which would suggest having done the equivalent of the Brown course), we publicizedthree different “certification levels”: Lite :Completing a sufficient number of daily quizzes (but no more) Mezzanine :Beyond Lite, completing the minor project that occupies the first month Ninja : BeyondMezzanine, completing the major project that occupies the remaining two months When we noticed that many of our initial sign-ups wereprofessional programmers, we added a fourth: Sprint : Theminor project, and quizzes during its duration The Sprint option enabled people to engage intensively forone month, and then disengage fully from the course and return to theirprofessional and other lives. The completion numbers indicate that this was a wiseaddition. BY THE NUMBERS We hadabout 1650+ signups initially. In keeping with all other MOOCs, attendancedropped off rapidly (especially after we made the opening assignment especiallyhard). Our completion ratio was about what one might expect for an upper-leveltechnical course: 80 students finished, distributed as follows: Lite : 23 Sprint : 23 Mezzanine : 32 Ninja : 2 The distribution of sign-ups looked like a heat-map ofcomputer science: large clusters in the US Northeast, the Pacific Northwest,and Northern and Southern California; a strong showing in the London area; andan especially strong cluster in India’s technology hub (and my hometown),Bangalore (now known as Bengalooru). We were surprised by the relative lack ofsignups from China, Japan, and Korea, but attributed this to our publicitymethods and to potential language difficulties. The distribution of finishers was not at all the same. Wehad one each from Argentina, Australia, Tanzania (a Dutchman who has livedthere for a long time doing missionary work with his doctor wife), Thailand,China, Finland, Belarus, Hungary, Romania, Belgium, Spain, and Portugal. OnlyRussia, Germany, Canada, Japan, and India, other than the US, provided multiplefinishers; the Indians were distributed around the country, in no way matchingthe distribution of signups. The American finishers also did not correspond tothe signup distribution, with a very strong showing from the Midwest andNortheast, nobody from the US Pacific Northwest, and one each from Northern andSouthern California. In general, therefore, tech hubs seem to offer masses ofenthusiasts whose initial interest does not translate into completion. (To ourdelight, though, we had at least one person on each settled continent!) I also analyzed the finishers by self-described occupation.“IT” means anyone in the computing industry; “student” could mean anywhere fromhigh-school upwards, though I don’t believe any of the high-schoolers whoenrolled got very far. Note that some people did not provide this information. Lite : IT: 6;students: 8; mathematician: 1 Sprint : IT:13; students (graduate-level): 2; finance: 1 Mezzanine : IT:14; students: 3; research scientist: 1; stay-at-home dad: 1; associateprofessor: 1 Ninja : IT: 2 IN TERMS OF PRIOR EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE: High school Bachelor's degree Post-bachelor degree Lite 4 5 3 Sprint 9 8 Mezzanine 8 9 7 Ninja 2 The ageswere distributed as follows; though we had several in the 13-18 age range signup, none of them survived the course: 19-25 26-34 35-50 Over 50 Lite 5 3 3 1 Sprint 3 8 5 1 Mezzanine 5 12 7 Ninja 1 1 Atsign-up, we also asked people what their likelihood was of finishing each ofthe certification levels. Suffice it to say these expectations greatly outstrippedreality (not least because roughly 1500 participants failed to complete anylevel). THE BOTTOM LINE I expectedmy in-class experience would remain largely unchanged, while I would learn mostfrom the on-line component. The exact reverse was true. The on-line componentwent along mostly predictable lines, with few surprises. In contrast, theprovision of videos had a dramatic and (in my mind) undesirable effect on thein-class experience: of sixty students, only about twenty attended class regularly. Many studentsattributed their lack of attendance to the “early” hour of the class: 10am onMWF. As a card-carrying computer scientist, I’m guilty of having had similarviews as an undergraduate. However, the same course has been offered at 10amfor years, and attendance was always close to perfect, and this year’s classdidn’t seem especially different in constitution. In short, there is the potential that the provision of videos will havea significant impact on class attendance, even in relatively interactive,discussion-oriented classes. PUBLICITY We madeour decision during the summer preceding the course, well before Brown’sCoursera announcement. We therefore had to do all publicity ourselves. We madeannouncements on some mailing lists, and on our own social media pages. We didnot employ any other means of advertisement, such as purchasing Google ads. Itwas never our goal to bulk up with large numbers of students (we were franklysurprised when signups first crossed 100!), so other means of advertising madeno sense. FORMAT I normally put all my course material on-line, without anyfirewall (like the abominable Blackboard and its siblings). What changed isthat we created mechanisms for grading on-line student work (more on thislater), and also published videos of all the classes. Rather than createoff-line video snippets (as used in flipped classrooms), we simply recordedclass and published it in full. Some on-line students reported that theyenjoyed the sense this gave of actually being in the class. To avoid visibility problems, I changed from writing on theboard to writing on a tablet computer projected on a screen: nearly the samewriting experience for me, but with perfect visibility on video. (Indeed, thetablet offered some advantages a whiteboard does not, such as the ability tomove a block of text from one location to another.) To protect the privacy ofstudents, we recorded from the back of the room so their faces were not seen. After every class, we converted the videos and publishedthem on YouTube. On-line student discussion took place on Piazza, where Brownstudents were welcome (but most did not actively participate, at least not byname). PLATFORMS Instead ofsticking with one packaged platform, we used a variety of on-line media: GooglePlus, Google Documents, Google Groups, Batchgeo (to make maps), Dropbox (toshare videos), Piazza (for discussion), JotForm (for uploading solutions),Brown Computer Science facilities, and software we wrote. We chose to do thisso we could better understand from scratch what tools such an effort needs, andnot be hemmed in by one platform. Because I had a staff of world-class problemsolvers, I was confident we could fight our way out of any tight corners, andthis approach indeed worked well. STUDY GROUPS We felt itwas important to help people form local study groups, and many students wereinterested in this, too. Lacking a platform to do this for us, we created anopen Google Map that any participant could edit, so they could drop pins indicatingwhere they were and find one another. This worked well enough, and severalstudy groups sprang up around the world. ONLINE STUDENT BEHAVIOR Theon-line students generally behaved in exemplary fashion. Once we had weeded outthe “tourists” (my term for those who were never going to be serious studentsin the class), the remainder were often genuinely grateful for the classexperience, and were far less demanding than I expected. Indeed, I think theywere undemanding to the point of hurting their educational experience. I was especiallyafraid of being pestered with email messages of the “i dont know how to installur software” variety. These never materialized. The few people who contacted usby email had good reasons and kept it brief and on point. We would actuallyhave enjoyed more interaction with some of the on-line students. Thebeginning of the semester was problematic on Piazza. Because there was nothingmuch to do, the on-line students turned it into yet another Web discussion site(perhaps to shake out their anxieties), holding forth vapidly on the coursetopic and much else. I believe this turned off many Brown students, in responseto which we created a Brown-only announcement mailing list. Perhaps if we hadperformed better crowd control initially, Piazza would have remained the singleforum everyone used. Iencountered only one moment of angst: when a male on-line student made aninappropriate remark responding to a female on-line student. I caught thiswithin an hour of its appearance (during which time it had received fewer thantwenty views), deleted it immediately, and posted a chastising comment on thediscussion site. Happily, the female student stayed with the course until thevery end, and remained a strong contributor. Therewas just one sense in which on-line students were very demanding: in digitalformats. We initially expected we would simply upload our videos to YouTube.But some students complained they couldn’t easily access YouTube, or wanted thevideo for off-line viewing (e.g., while commuting to and from work), so we hadto make a direct link also accessible. Some wanted low-resolution versions ofthe video due to weak Internet access. Some wanted access to the digitalversion of what I wrote on the “board”. Some even wanted only audio access to thelectures. Keeping all these different needs satisfied was a significant andconstant burden. Surveys suggested each of these formats was useful to justenough students to be worth continuing to provide, and once we had begun tooffer one we couldn’t take it away. Thetiming of our home works had an interesting and unintended consequence. BecauseI was redesigning the course from scratch, many of the projects were brand newand needed debugging. We put out assignments on Fridays. Most of the on-linestudents, being working professionals, did them immediately, and helped us findand fix most of the problems. Thus, by the time most Brown students got to theassignments, they encountered much better versions of them. STAFFING I did not have any additional resources to teach the on-lineoffering. My regular course staff consisted of my grad TA and six undergradTAs. I informed the undergrad TAs that, because this was a project being run bymy grad TA and me, they were under no obligation to participate. Though they largelydid not help with Piazza, the video recording and publication was handledalmost entirely by them. (These videos obviously benefited the undergrads also,but without them there would have been no on-line course at all, so in thatsense the UTAs were indispensable. To wit, I’d like to thank Liam Elberty,Jonah Kagan, Peter Kaufman, Scott Newman, Jon Sailor, and Varun Singh.) COMPARISON TO COURSE GRADES Several people have asked me how these certification levelscorrespond to letter grades. They don’t at all, because the Brown students hadto do additional work (the written home works). However, very loosely, doing areasonable job on the written home works, combined with completing the Sprintrequirements, earned a C; doing better on the written home works and completingthe Ninja requirements at a reasonable level earned a B; and doing well on boththe written home works and the Ninja requirements earned an A. In short, thegrade requirements for Brown students were much higher than for on-linestudents (which is why we created entirely different names rather than usingletter grades). Despite this, Brown students did much better than the on-linestudents: 40 A’s, 7 B’s, 8 C’s, and 8 NC’s (in a non-required course). GRADING Because we only graded the programming-related assignmentsfor on-line students, all their grading could be automated. Most on-lineprogramming courses have students upload programs that are run by gradingscripts. We decided that we didn’t want the headache of dealing withpotentially malicious programs (it may help—or hurt—that Joe and I both docomputer security research), nor the expense of running these programs on acloud provider. We therefore instead handed out a binary program for eachassignment that would run the same checks on the students’ own machine, andreport the results back to us. (As Joe pointed out, this puts the trustrelationship in the right direction: we have no reason to trust them, but ifthey don’t trust us enough to run our program, why are they taking a coursefrom us?) Of course, when the students are reporting their answers tous, it’s too easy for them to cheat. We therefore embedded a little ad hoccryptographic protocol—Joe appositely labeled it “craptography”—in the gradingprograms to make this difficult. Our goal was not to create somethingimpregnable, but rather to prevent casual and, indeed, all but determined cheating.This process worked well in retrospect. WHO GAINED FROM THIS EXERCISE? I gained the most. I got to experiment with what is clearlyan upcoming challenge to our profession. I got the opportunity to reach out towhole new segments of the computing population. (We already have a new master’sstudent applicant from this on-line audience, and I wouldn’t be surprised ifsome of the participants end up becoming PhD applicants down the road.) Joe and the other course staff also learned a lot about theneeds and demands of on-line teaching platforms. One TA, in particular, has adeep interest in MOOCs, and has been considering job offers from companies suchas Coursera and Khan Academy. For these students it was a valuable real-worldsoftware requirements-gathering experience. The benefits for Brown students were probably fewer, butthat is also because we worked to insulate them from the on-line crowd. I dothink the students benefited some from interactions, especially withprofessionals. For instance, they got to see some important differences betweenhow they and professionals tackled some tasks, and at least some students foundthis thought-provoking. My wife pointed out one subtle benefit for Brown.Overthe years, I’ve found it difficult to explain the chasm between our courses andthose almost everywhere else (in the world). Offerings like this give the worlda window into what we do, and let them judge just how demanding (and good) ourcourses are. This raises the profile of our students with potential employersand others who need to evaluate them. By not only being uncompromising in thequality of our courses but by also showing that there’s more to a Brown coursethan what is offered on-line, we also signal to the best students worldwidethat we are a place where they might feel at home.Brown CS Blog Categories Awards (                                        23 articles                                    ) Diversity (                                        72 articles                                    ) Socially Responsible Computing (                                        17 articles                                    ) Artemis 2013 Posted by Angel Murakami on Sept. 18, 2013 in Diversity by Karishma Bhatia and April Tran Community outreach connects Brown CS students to the Providence area. For more articles on how Brown CS students inspire and lead members of the greater Providence community click here . On the surface, Artemis is a summer program geared towards teaching young girls computer skills, programming, and computer science concepts through a challenging curriculum. Yet to the individuals that actually go through the Artemis experience, we learn that Artemis is much, much more. Yes, the program is about learning the science behind the modern machines we use everyday, but perhaps just as important, it helps the amazing young ladies that attend Artemis to build confidence in themselves, in their ability to build relationships with others, and their capacity to self learn. Though we can only possibly glimpse a portion of what the Artemis experience is like for its students, as directors we have learned life lessons and gleaned inspiration from our young students. As college undergraduates, in the midst of juggling multiple exams, papers, and projects, we often forget what it means to learn. Gone are the days in which making a small mistake for the sake of learning doesn't cost you a letter grade. Many of us no longer have the privilege or courage to test a teacher's or parent's patience with question upon question. We may never again have the opportunity or time to take complete advantage of our curiosity by letting our minds wander for hours or even days. Looking back, we realize just how valuable and precious such experiences were in our growth as students, innovators, and individuals. More broadly, we realize how important it is for our society---especially in academic institutions---to create such learning environments for youth in the community while continuing to encourage them to pursue their interests. Artemis started as a program for inner-city girls entering ninth grade to learn computer science. This year, we focused on making Artemis a program that helped students not only discover computer science, but discover a creative way to use the concepts they learned in their own hobbies and interests. Sometimes that meant a student realizing she had a knack for web-design and building a website featuring the work of her favorite artist--other times it meant a student realizing she was a poet and building a website featuring her own work. Artemis helped these girls build confidence in their own skills and talents while adding to them. How can we put into words the beauty of Iris' glowing smile when her friends praised the personal works she put on her website? The sense of accomplishment Jamie had watching the game she built in Scratch run perfectly?  Or the surge of confidence Desiree felt presenting her final project to a crowd of parents? How can we describe the satisfaction of seeing the understanding on our girls' faces after we explained a difficult concept? By creating a positive association to computer science for our Artemis students, we ensure that they will not shy away from using technology to build creative solutions to relevant problems. They will not forgo their passions, they will not forget that they are capable of finding friends in the most unlikely people, and most importantly, they will not fear the challenge of learning something new.Brown CS Blog Categories Awards (                                        23 articles                                    ) Diversity (                                        72 articles                                    ) Socially Responsible Computing (                                        17 articles                                    ) Brown CS And CCMB To Enjoy Record Participation At ISMB 2014 Posted by Jesse Polhemus on July 8, 2014 In addition to advancing the field at a local and national level, Brown CS community members have a global impact on education and research. For more articles on Brown CS around the world click here . Brown University ’s Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) and Center for Computational Molecular Biology (CCMB) are looking forward to giving a record number of talks at one of the most prominent conferences in computational biology. Current and former students and post-docs of professor Ben Raphael presenting at the twenty-second annual International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB 2014) in Boston include Iman Hajirasouliha , Max Leiserson , Layla Oesper , Anna Ritz , and Hsin-Ta Wu , featuring work co-authored with Ahmad Mahmoody , Gryte Satas , and Suzanne Sindi . Ben credits the strong Brown CS representation to a little bit of fortunate timing and a lot of ongoing effort from a dedicated group of researchers. “It’s surprising that all these projects came together at the same time,” he says, “but it shows that we have a hard-working group with a strong culture of mentoring to help each person reach their full potential. Our small size requires excellence across the whole team, and I’m proud that we’re able to compete successfully against much larger groups, not only in CS but also in medical schools and research institutes.” Layla Oesper and Gryte Satas are happy denizens of what they consider to be a technological leading edge. “Understanding/analyzing sequencing data from cancer genomes is a difficult task,” they explain. “There are many factors that make identifying the landscape of mutations in a heterogeneous tumor sample hard.  Our algorithms are aimed at quantifying this type of information, an important first step in determining what mutations drive cancer. This wasn’t possible even five years ago, and it lets us make use of the vast amount of data that has been accumulating." “We’re also looking forward to the inaugural Raphael Reunion!” they laugh, explaining that the conference will allow all of Ben’s current and former students to reunite in Boston. What do all these colleagues have in common? “Momentum, collaboration, and energy,” says Layla. They’re qualities that are evidently shared by their mentor. “Ben is as passionate about our work as he is about his own,” Gryte says. “How does he find the time to sleep?” Ben shrugs. “What makes me happy is that all these projects include multiple authors who are great team players. Because our group is part of a CS department, we can recruit people with strong skills in algorithm development and program design, which really gives us an edge.” Max Leiserson’s collaborators, in addition to Raphael, include two researchers from Tel Aviv University. His highlight talk focuses on a paper they published a year ago, about an algorithm developed by Brown CS called Multi-Dendrix . Without prior information, it searches for genes with approximately exclusive mutations and high coverage in a cohort of tumors, which enables the identification of “driver” genetic pathways that cause cancer when mutated. Asked for his goals for the conference, Max says, “I’m looking forward to all the talks, the chance to learn from others. My biggest hope is that people will get excited about our results and even more cancer researchers will use our software.” He explains that external researchers will have an even easier time using Brown CS tools in the future: currently, some of the applications necessary to run Multi-Dendrix are proprietary and need to be purchased, but an upcoming transition to entirely open-source software will allow maximal ease of use. While working under Raphael, Iman Hajirasouliha, Anna Ritz, and Hsin-Ta Wu’s collaborators have included colleagues from the bioscience industry as well as academia (Brown University and elsewhere). Hsin-Ta will present a paper on detecting copy number aberrations in cancer co-authored with Iman, and Iman will present a paper on intra-tumor heterogeneity co-authored with Brown CS’s Ahmad Mahmoody. Both were among 29 papers directly accepted in the first round of peer reviews, out of 204 submissions. “Only recently,” Iman comments, “have scientists realized that mutations that we formerly thought of collectively, such as breast cancer or lung cancer, actually vary considerably from person to person. Our task now is to characterize heterogeneous mutations across a tumor. It’s a major step forward.” “I’m really eager to introduce people at the conference to our new research about finding driver recurrent copy number aberrations,” adds Hsin-Ta. “Our new method has advantages in not only accurately identifying candidate copy number aberrations which could drive cancer but providing an algorithm which is simple and fast, and readily adaptable for high-throughput sequencing data. For us as computer scientists, in the future it will be exciting to apply this method to larger cancer datasets as more and more cancer patients are sequenced.” Ritz and Hajirasouliha’s shared research into structural variants across a single genome, not specific to a particular disease, was partially aimed at the challenges caused by software limitations. “Second-generation sequencing platforms,” Anna explains, “are slow but quite accurate, with an error rate of one or two percent. Third-generation technology gives a more in-depth analysis, but has a fifteen percent error rate. Our algorithm is probabilistic, and it shows that combining the two platforms allows you to reduce the impact of errors while maximizing the third-generation benefits.” Anna sees real parallels between Brown CS’s progress in computational biology and the field’s increasing opportunities: “Ben’s first year at Brown was my first year as a graduate student. His great ability to locate the next big problem is helping us make major contributions to the field. Just as one example, our results are helping overcome the hesitation about third-generation sequencing paradigms. If we can prove their worth, they’ll get used, and medical progress will be made.” Ben agrees. “It’s so exciting,” he says, addressing prospective ISMB 2014 attendees and celebrating the members of the research group that he’s put together. “We’re thrilled to be building on our long-term record of strength in this field, to share our results and demonstrate what a great environment we have for students of all levels. I hope my team gets to see the appreciation for their research.  I think it will help them understand how much all their effort, day in and day out, has achieved.”Brown CS Blog Categories Awards (                                        23 articles                                    ) Diversity (                                        72 articles                                    ) Socially Responsible Computing (                                        17 articles                                    ) Genevieve Patterson Helps Organize LDV Vision Summit, Sees Opportunity For Undergrads Posted by Jesse Polhemus on June 19, 2014 Brown University Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) PhDstudent Genevieve Patterson has justhelped organize the LDV Vision Summit, a start-up conference held in New YorkCity to address trends and technologies in digital imaging and video technology.Founded by Evan Nisselson of LDV Capital, an investment group interested in technology-focusedprojects across the imaging/video spectrum, the summit brought together top technologistsand investors with the purpose of shaping the future of imaging and video. Genevieve’sprevious work with professor Serge Belongie of Cornell Tech, one of Nisselson’scollaborators, made her a natural choice to help run competitions and pre-judgeentrants for a vibrant and diverse conference. “The summit featured anincredible variety of startups from all over the world,” she explains. “They’recreating state-of-the-art solutions for emerging topics, from wearable camerasto object detection to human tracking. Some of the solutions are extremelyhigh-tech, while others are simple and consumer-facing.” Thesummit included multiple keynote addresses (Jan Erik Solem of Mapillary on “CrowdsourcingMap Photos” and Rob Fergus of NYU and Facebook AI on “Recent Progress InComputer Vision Using Deep Learning” as just two examples), panels on such topicsas the future of cameras and image recognition, and two competitions. Thefirst, an entrepreneurial computer vision challenge, allowed experts todemonstrate solutions for problems such as summarizing video, detecting and recognizingwords in YouTube video frames, and predicting the relative attributes for pairsof men and women’s shoes. Thesecond, a startup pitch competition, was won by Alexandre Alahi of VisioSafe,whose company uses networked cameras to analyze human behavior in physicalspaces. “They went up against some impressive challengers and won,” saysGenevieve. “What they’re able to do is anonymously collect patterns of movementand then provide metrics, so their clients can make better use of any location,from malls to public parks. They’re already working with Swiss Rail to improvetheir stations. It’s an exciting example of the opportunities that this fieldhas to offer.” Inparticular, Genevieve wants to point out th at undergraduatecomputer science students are poised to take advantage of the considerableopportunities that are being created. “The fundamental challenges of computervision are still new to industry,” she says, “and that requires researchers.The dozens of startups seen at LDV Vision Summit need employees. They want studentsto get interested in the field today. The problems are still open, and theproducts that we have yet to see are going to create radical change in so manyaspects of everyday life.” Anyoneinterested in the LDV Vision Summit can click here to follow them on Twitter,click here to go to theirWeb page, or click here to sign up for their newsletter for details on next year’s conference.Brown CS Blog Categories Awards (                                        23 articles                                    ) Diversity (                                        72 articles                                    ) Socially Responsible Computing (                                        17 articles                                    ) Brown CS Finds A Unique Way To Celebrate Impressive Heidelberg Laureate Forum Representation Posted by Jesse Polhemus on Oct. 1, 2014 in Diversity In addition to advancing the field at a local and national level, Brown CS community members have a global impact on education and research. For more articles on Brown CS around the world click here . Thirty-five years after the founding of the department, Brown CS attendance at international conferences is anything but uncommon: strong representation and participation are the norm. But the three students who flew to last week’s Heidelberg Laureate Forum (HLF) took an unusual step to bring Brown CS spirit to the event, expanding departmental tradition and proving themselves right at home in a world-class environment where collaboration thrives. Now in its second year, the HLF provides an annual gathering in which Abel, Fields, and Turing laureates interact with 200 of the world’s best young minds, divided evenly between computer scientists and mathematicians. Irina Calciu , Max Leiserson , and Layla Oesper were selected from a pool of more than 2000 applicants, and they were joined by alumnus Matthew Lease PhD ‘10, providing Brown with an impressive 4% of worldwide CS attendees at the conference and 20% of American ones. They were also accompanied by a chicken. (If you’re not familiar with the rubber chicken tradition at Brown CS, click here .) “It just seemed like a good idea!” laughs Layla. “We were so excited about meeting the laureates and the incredible diversity of researchers. There were students from six different continents! We decided it would be fun to take pictures of a Brown CS rubber chicken traveling the world, meeting people, and showing our pride at having four attendees.” The chicken complied, dutifully posing for pictures with Vint Cerf and John Hopcroft, atop castles, on a boat trip, and even during an Oktoberfest celebration.  (A selection of photos is available here .) Structured as a mix of presentations and social events, the Forum’s informal talks included sometimes unexpected advice (Leslie Lamport told listeners that since they spend more time sending e-mail than doing anything else, they should edit each message as if looking to publish them) and frequently had a galvanizing effect. “After hearing John Hopcroft talk about changes in theory needed to support changes in our field,” Max remembers, “the whole room was energized, and he was swarmed by people. But we’d already met him when he sat down to have lunch with us the day before, possibly because we were carrying a rubber chicken!” All three students note that while they were interested in finding peers with similar scientific interests (Layla mentions that a new friend may soon be using an algorithm developed by Ben Raphael’s group), delving deeper into one’s own research area wasn’t the conference’s true rationale. “HLF gives you a high-level perspective on worldwide research that you hadn’t known was going on, and how the two disciplines benefit each other, such as computer simulations of mathematical work,” notes Max. “But the socialization and interaction are what makes it all approachable. It’s where the real learning happens.” Bringing a chicken everywhere also had some unexpected (and positive) consequences. “Not only did the chicken start conversations,” says Irina, “It caused people to tell us stories about traditions at their universities. That made me proud that tradition is so strong here at Brown CS.  It defines us. We have a real commitment to getting to know everybody in the department and collaborating, and we brought that spirit to the Heidelberg Laureate Forum.” The next time you attend a conference, bring a chicken with you, take a picture, and send it to Jesse Polhemus (jcp@cs.brown.edu).

Everything heexpected to be challenging is even tougher than anticipated: generative recursion,writing specifications instead of implementations, learning how to test his codeinstead of just writing it. Worst of all is the workload. On any given night, he’saveraging –this seems too cruel to be possible– no more than eight or ninehours of sleep. Wait,what?  Everyone knows that CS students don't get any sleep, so eight ornine hours is out of the question. Or is it? Recent findings from PhD student Joseph Gibbs Politz , adjunct professor Kathi Fisler , and professor Shriram Krishnamurthi analyze whenstudents completed tasks in two different BrownCS classes, shedding interestinglight on an age-old question: when do our students work, and when (if ever) dothey sleep? The question calls to mind a popular conception of the computerscientist that Luis has likely seen in countless movies and books: Hours are late. (A recent poster to boardgames@lists.cs.brown.edu requests a 2 PM start time in order to avoid being “ridiculouslyearly” for prospective players.) Sleep is minimal. BrownCS alumnus AndyHertzfeld, writing about the early days of Apple Computer in Revolution inthe Valley, describes the “gigantic bag of chocolate-covered espressobeans” and “medicinal quantities of caffeinated beverages” that allowed days ofuninterrupted coding. Part 1: Deadline Experiments Thestory begins a few years before Luis’s arrival, when Shriram would routinely schedulehis assignments to be due at the 11:00 AM start of class. “Students lookedexhausted,” he remembers. “They were clearly staying up all night in order tocomplete the assignment just prior to class.” Initially,he moved the deadline to 2:00 AM, figuring that night owl students would finishwork in the early hours of the morning and then get some sleep. This waseffective, but someone pointed out that it was unfair to other professors whotaught earlier classes and were forced to deal with tired students who hadfinished Shriram’s assignment but not slept sufficiently. “Myfinal step,” he explains, “was to change deadlines to midnight. I also beganpenalizing late assignments on a 24-hour basis instead of an hourly one. Thisencourages students to get a full night’s sleep even if they miss a deadline.” Thiswas the situation when Luis arrives. The next task was to start measuring theresults. Part2: Tracking Events Shriram,Kathi, and Joe analyzed two of Shriram’s classes, CS 019 and CS 1730. For eachclass, Luis must submit test suites at any time he chooses, then read reviewsof his work from fellow students. He then continues working on the solution,eventually producing a final implementation that must be submitted prior to themidnight deadline. Part3: Reality And Mythology Giventhese parameters, what work and sleep patterns would you expect? We asked professorTom Doeppner to reflect on Luis and share his experience of working closelywith students as Director of Undergraduate Studies and Director of the Master’sProgram. “Do students work late? I know I get e-mail from students at all hoursof the night,” he says, “and I found out quickly that morning classes areunpopular, which is why I teach in the afternoon. Maybe it’s associated withage? I liked to work late when I was young, but I got out of the habit in mythirties.” Askedabout the possible mythologizing of late nights and sleeplessness, Tom tells astory from his own teaching: “Before we broke up CS 169 into two classes, thestudents had t-shirts made: ‘CS 169: Because There Are Only 168 Hours In AWeek’. I think there’s definitely a widespread belief that you’re not really workinghard unless you’re pulling multiple all-nighters.” Thisdoesn’t exactly sound like Luis’s sleep habits! Take a look at the graphs belowto see how mythology and reality compare. Part4: Results And Conclusions Thegraphs below depict test suite submissions, with time displayed in six-hoursegments. For example, between 6 PM and the midnight deadline (“6-M”), 50 CS173 students are submitting tests. Thisgraph is hypothetical, showing Joe, Kathi, and Shriram’s expectations forsubmission activity. They expected activity to be slow and increase steadily,culminating in frantic late-night activity just before the deadline. Generallytaller “M-6” (midnightto 6 AM) bars indicate late-night work and a corresponding flurryof submissions, followed by generally shorter “6-N” (6 AM to noon) bars whenstudents tried to get a few winks in. Cumulatively, these two trends depict thepopular conception of the computer science student who favors late hours andperpetually lacks sleep. Thesegraphs show actual submissions.  Asexpected, activity generally increases over time and the last day contains themajority of submissions. However, unexpectedly, the “N-6” (noon to 6 PM) and “6-M”(6 PM to midnight) segments are universally the most active. In the case of the CS173 graph, this morning segment contains far more submissions than any other ofthe day’s three segments. In both of these graphs, the “M-6” (midnight to 6 AM) segmentsare universally the least active, even the day the assignment is due. For example, the final segment of this type,which represents the last available span of early morning hours, is among thelowest of all segments, with only ten submissions occurring. In contrast, thecorresponding “6-N” (6 AM to noon) shows more than four times as manysubmissions, suggesting that most students do their work before or after thepre-dawn hours but not during them. “Iwouldn’t have expected that,” Joe comments. “I think of the stories folks tellof when they work not lining up with that, in terms of staying up late and gettingup just in time for class. Our students have something important to do atmidnight other than work: they cut off their work before midnight and dosomething else. For the majority it’s probably sleep, but it could just besocial time or other coursework. Either way, it’s an interestingacross-the-board behavior.” Ifword of these results gets out, what can Luis and his fellow students expect?“People will realize,” Shriram says, “that despite what everyone likes toclaim, students even in challenging courses really are getting sleep, so it’sokay for them to, too.” Joe agrees: “There isn’t so much work in CS that youhave to sacrifice normal sleeping hours for it.” Luis,his family, and his well-rested classmates will undoubtedly be glad to hear it.The only question is: will their own descriptions of their work/sleep habitschange to match reality, or are tales of hyper-caffeinated heroics too temptingto resist?Brown CS Blog Categories Awards (                                        23 articles                                    ) Diversity (                                        72 articles                                    ) Socially Responsible Computing (                                        17 articles                                    ) Anna Lysyanskaya Offers Ukraine Commentary On WPRI Posted by Jesse Polhemus on July 22, 2014 In addition to advancing the field at a local and national level, Brown CS community members have a global impact on education and research.

The Brown University Humans To Robots Lab, headed by Professor Stefanie Tellex, hosted the 2014 Northeast Robotics Colloquium last week. Drones that can deliver packages bumped up against robots that have already moved millions of greenhouse plants, and aerospace resins met 3D printers. The event was part conference, part trade-show, with a large poster session for academic groups, and booths for private robotic firms. Keynote speakers were Holly Yanco (UMass Lowell), Bertram Malle (Brown University), Joe Jones (Harvest Automation), and Nicholas Roy (MIT, Google). Each speaker covered a different aspect of moving robotics forward in terms of theoretical ability and practical integration in society. Holly Yanco described the NERVE Center, a 10,000 square-foot indoor testing center for mobile robots. The Center contains a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) compliant course as well as proprietary water and indoor rain environments. Nicholas Roy spoke about accurate SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) with small drones, and his practical implementation of such techniques during his stay at Google X. While there, he lead Project Wing, a drone delivery program. Joe Jones, a veteran of both MIT and iRobot (the company behind Roomba), described his new company, Harvest Automation, and its goal to automate jobs in the world's greenhouses and nurseries. Specifically, they address the nurseries’ need to evenly spread thousands of potted plants across a surface. Where this job is considered to be one of the nursery's most unpleasant, Harvest Automation's fleet of HV-100s have moved over 7 million plants without complaint. Attendees prepare for the next speaker Event sponsors were private robotics firms interested in facilitating skill transfer between groups, and recruiting students and researchers looking to move to industry. Turn-out was larger than expected, with over 150 people interacting at the venue, Brown's Alumnae Hall. "The space was amazing," said volunteer coordinator John Oberlin. "It really allowed for a diversity of research interests to intermingle." His favorite moment? "My favorite demo was a group who were 3D printing using aerospace resins." ​Brown student Miles Eldon shows off his gesture and speech interpreter Overall, the hosts were very pleased with the strong response. "I think it was really fun," said Stefanie. “I think it's good for undergrads and new graduate students to experience a conference, before they've necessarily published a paper. It shows what research is all about, gets them plugged in." Many attendees were also pleased that children and families were invited. Stefanie’s two-year old son, Jay, had a great time at the conference. “I’m so excited that he’s excited about robots. He loved seeing Keepon and Dragonbot, and he got to drive Kinova’s Jaco arm.” Keynote speaker Nicholas Roy, one of several attendees who wouldn’t have come if families hadn’t been invited, brought his wife and three kids to NERC. Their whole family really enjoyed the event. "The kids now believe that all robots come from Rhode Island," he said later.

For the past several years, Brown University Departmentof Computer Science professor Michael Littman has beenextending a family tradition of writing spoof songs by making music videos toreinforce concepts taught in his classes. “I was always a big fan of Weird AlYankovic,” Michael says, “His gift for wordplay and ear for rhythm areunmatched.” While teaching a class on artificial intelligence back in 2001,Billy Joel’s “We Didn’t Start The Fire” provided Littman with inspiration tosummarize class topics (“XOR, learning rate, squash the sum and integrate”) andthe string of videos began. They’re rapidly becoming a viralphenomenon. One frequently-retweeted video features Michael, professor CharlesIsbell of Georgia Tech, and a Georgia Tech vocal group. It’s based on MichaelJackson’s “Thriller” and focuses on the problem of overfitting in machinelearning. It’s available here ,and is unique in that it was made with the help of a video editor. “Most of mysongs have been weekend hacks with just me, Garage Band, iMovie, and Keynote,”Michael explains. Another video (available here ), for CS 8, spoofsthe Queen song “Flash” and teaches about the programming language Scratch. Itfeatures the undergraduate teaching assistants from the class and a cameo fromMichael. Neither of them are as popular as his “The Sorter” video, which hasreceived 54, 225 views and is still climbing. “Most of what I know about Englishgrammar and the U.S. Constitution comes from watching ‘Schoolhouse Rock’ songsas a kid,” Michael says. “The experience taught me that some concepts stickbetter if they’re put to music.

It is an event designed to give students a taste of the challenges that face White House policy makers when responding to national cybersecurity threats. Twenty-two teams participated in the event representing twenty-four universities from as far away as Turkey and Estonia. A team of four Brown sophomores made an excellent showing. They not only advanced to the semifinal stage, they won the prize for Best Teamwork against much older teams. The “Brown Secure” team consisted of Samuel Brebner, Jason Ginsberg, Dan Meyers, and Jared Schober. I was faculty coach. Brown Secure was the youngest team to advance to the semifinal round and probably the youngest team in the competition. The competition consisted of three rounds in which students formulated four alternative responses to a crisis described in an intelligence brief. In each case teams had ten minutes to describe their responses and took ten minutes of questions. Preparation time for the first round lasted one week, the second twelve hours overnight, and the third thirty minutes. The Brown students benefited greatly from the trip, met prominent national security experts, and established a strong reputation for Brown at this event.Brown CS Blog Categories Awards (                                        23 articles                                    ) Diversity (                                        72 articles                                    ) Socially Responsible Computing (                                        17 articles                                    ) Sorin Istrail Receives NSF Grant For Haplotype Reconstruction Algorithms Posted by Sorin Istrail on April 16, 2014 Brown CS community members continue to win noteworthy grants and awards. To read more articles click here . Sorin Istrail has received funding for the NSF grant “Genome-Wide Algorithms for Haplotype Reconstruction and Beyond: A Combined Haplotype Assembly and Identical-by-Descent Tracts Approach”. Human genomes are diploids, which means that each human has two haplotypes, one inherited from the mother and one inherited by the father; each haplotype is a set (chromosomes) of sequences of about 3.2 billions of A, C, G, and T. These haplotypes are mosaics of haplotype regions inherited from ancestors as a result of two major forces of evolution: recombination and mutation. When two or more individuals inherit the same haplotype region from a common ancestor, the shared region is called a “tract” and it is said to be inherited “identical-by-descent” (IBD). Tracts have the same start and end coordinates on genomes sharing them. The “logic” of detection of disease associations is rooted in the inference of tracts. For example, if a set of autistic patients is found to share a tract, and a certain gene is found part of this tract, this gene becomes a candidate gene for an ancestral model of autism inheritance. Preliminary work together with his PhD student Derek Aguiar succeeded in solving a major open problem of the influential Li-Stephens statistical framework (2003) for modeling linkage disequilibrium, recombination hotspots and haplotype phasing; this framework enabled some of the most practical genome-wide association study (GWAS) software tools to date. A major bottleneck was the failure of “exchangeability” of the statistical process (the output of the algorithm depended on the order in which the input was processed). The combinatorial solution that achieved exchangeability led to the first exact sub-quadratic (close to linear) and practical algorithm, Tractatus, for detecting the complete multi-shared identical-by-descent tracts in a GWAS sample of individuals (current GWAS input size is a matrix with several billions entries). The name of the algorithm was inspired by Ludwig Wittgenstein ’s Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. The grant proposes a comprehensive algorithmic framework for haplotype reconstruction using haplotype assembly (the HapCompass framework), haplotype phasing and generalizations of Tractatus to address the problem of haplotype reconstruction in polyploidy organisms and medical aneuploidy.Brown CS Blog Categories Awards (                                        23 articles                                    ) Diversity (                                        72 articles                                    ) Socially Responsible Computing (                                        17 articles                                    ) Students "Bootstrap" Algebra From Video Games Posted by Jesse Polhemus on May 2, 2014 in Diversity by Kevin Stacey (Science News Officer, Physical Sciences) Community outreach connects Brown CS students to the Providence area. For more articles on how Brown CS students inspire and lead members of the greater Providence community click here . Middle school teacher Adam Newall calls it “the eternal question” of introductory algebra. As students tread water in a sea of variables, functions, and graphs, they’re bound to ask it: “When are we ever going to use any of this?” But Newall, who teaches at Pembroke Community Middle School in Pembroke, Mass., is hearing that question a lot less often lately. He’s using a new curriculum in his seventh and eighth grade math classes that answers it right off the bat — and in a way that kids find hard to resist. The curriculum, called Bootstrap, teaches students to program their own video games — a task that just happens to require understanding and applying fundamental concepts of algebra. Newall says the approach does wonders, engaging students in a subject from which they might otherwise shy away. “The idea of making a video game is the allure,” he said. “But it opens [students] to the idea that they can learn math, and it’s not something that’s meant to torture people. They learn that math is something that is real and relevant and that they can use it.” Bootstrap is a group effort of Emmanuel Schanzer, a former computer programmer turned math teacher and now a Ph.D. student in the Harvard Graduate School of Education; Kathi Fisler, professor of computer science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute; and Shriram Krishnamurthi, professor of computer science at Brown. It builds on two decades of work done at Northeastern, Brown, and other universities. Middle school kids ”go from saying, ‘Math is hard,’ to saying, ‘I can’t do math.’ ... We’d like to get to them before they make that decision.” The curriculum started as a 10-week after-school program, which has been taught successfully around the country for six years. Now, based on the success of the after-school experience, Bootstrap is transitioning into an in-school program. The Bootstrap organization has set up training seminars for teachers around the country, and a few schools — like Newall’s Pembroke Community Middle School — are already using the curriculum. Two new partnerships promise to bring Bootstrap to many more schools. Code.org , a national nonprofit that aims to expand computer science instruction in public schools, recently named Bootstrap as its official middle school math curriculum. CSNYC, a New York City-based group with similar goals, has adopted Bootstrap as well. This summer, as Code.org rolls out its national curriculum, the Bootstrap team will give additional training seminars to teachers all over the country interested in trying Bootstrap. More than just fun and games While the educators are mostly interested in the underlying math concepts, for the students, it’s the games they create that are the stars of the show. “The whole curriculum is a sequence of steps that get you to the point where you have a working game at the end,” Krishnamurthi said. “Once we tell them they’re going to make their own game, the motivation is done. We don’t have to say any more.” Conceptually the games are fairly simple (though surprisingly addictive). Students choose a main character, a goal for that character to reach, and a danger to avoid. Then the students learn a simple programming language to put it all in motion. And that’s where algebra comes in. For example, in order for the program to know if a character has reached her goal or been stymied by an obstacle, the relative positions of objects must be plotted on a Cartesian grid. “To do that, we’re going to need to know the Pythagorean theorem,” Newall said. “To understand the Pythagorean theorem we need to know square roots and squares. And [the students] will follow a lesson on how those things work in order to make it work in their game. They’re so eager to own that.” When all is said and done, each student has a game to show off to friends and a working understanding of variables, functions, and other fundamental algebra concepts that align with Common Core math standards. Right skills, right time One of the reasons Krishnamurthi is so eager to get the curriculum into more middle school classes is that it catches kids at a crucial time. “Research has found that kids change the way they talk about math right around this age,” he said. “They go from saying, ‘math is hard,’ to saying, ‘I can’t do math.’ And that’s the point where kids make the decision to drop out of algebra. When they do, they’ve actually made a career decision without even knowing it, because there’s nothing you can do in a STEM field without algebra. We’d like to get to them before they make that decision to drop out, so they at least have they can keep their options open.” But algebra isn’t the only thing students learn through Bootstrap. They also become familiar with ins and outs of coding, a crucial skill in an increasingly digital world. When students present their games to their classmates, they’re also expected to stand up and explain the code that makes it work — an exercise software engineers call a code review. “I do code reviews with my college students,” Krishnamurthi said. “They are one of the most challenging experiences a college student can have. It’s a hard-core professional skill. We teach it to middle schoolers as a natural part of our curricular design.” The first time Newall taught the class, those code reviews were given at a launch party at semester’s end. “The superintendent came; parents came. Just the amount of celebration from kids making a one-screen, side scrolling video game was more than I had ever anticipated,” Newall said. And as for that eternal math class question, Newall says his Bootstrap students are now asking a new question. “They go from, ‘What are we going to use this for?’ to ‘What are we going to use this for next?’”Brown CS Blog Categories Awards (                                        23 articles                                    ) Diversity (                                        72 articles                                    ) Socially Responsible Computing (                                        17 articles                                    ) Middle Schoolers get tour of Robotics Lab for Brown 250+ Celebrations Posted by John Raiti on March 17, 2014 in Diversity Community outreach connects Brown CS students to the Providence area.

The robotics open house was hosted by the Brown Robotics Lab on first floor of the CIT Building.  Visitors were greeted in the lobby by Morgan Jenkins using a telepresence robot.  Through the telepresence robot, Morgan answered questions about the robotics lab and accompanied visitors to one of two rooms: 1) CIT 121 where Dr. John Raiti demonstrated flight of quad rotor helicopters through web technologies developed at Brown.  This project is enabling quadriplegics around the world to fly helicopters around campus. Recent talks by Prof. Chad Jenkins for TED and National Geographic has more information about this project. 2) CIT 134 where Prof. Jenkins demonstrated the PR2 robot recognizing and grasping household objects in an experimental domestic environment.  This work is aimed to assist senior citizens and the physically disabled in their activities of daily living (e.g., cleaning, food preparation and consumption).  We eventually want to enable more people to live independently at home without requiring institutionalization in assisted living facilities.

In one of Brown's introductory computer science classes, CS015, I think a successful effort has been made to encourage women to continue coding. The class provides many women role models in the TAs, of whom about half are women. I also appreciated the fact that in the lecture on the history of computer science, just as many important women figures were included as male. Talking to students in CS017, another introductory computer science class, I heard similar experiences. While women were outnumberd by men, one student told me that she didn't feel like she was at a disadvantage because there were enough other women in the class. Also, she shared that the professor and the TAs made everyone feel included. Perhaps it's necessary in these classes to reach a critical mass, along with other encouraging factors, to make sure minorities are not dissuaded. It seems like the critical mass has been achieved for women in these classes, but not necessarily for other minorities. What is it like to be a minority in an introductory computer science class? When I reflect on my experience in CS015 last semester as someone who identifies as female, a minority among coders, I feel the class was welcoming. There was such a large number of students in the class that there was a diversity in backgrounds such as class year and coding experience (more than 50% had never coded before).  But while the amount of women in introductory classes such as CS015 may have reached critical mass, the numbers of other minority groups are still not there yet. Introductory classes still have a way to go to make everyone feel included, but I didn't feel discouraged from coding because I was a woman in CS015.Brown CS Blog Categories Awards (                                        23 articles                                    ) Diversity (                                        72 articles                                    ) Socially Responsible Computing (                                        17 articles                                    ) #YurtAtBrown Posted by Jesse Polhemus on Nov. 10, 2014 For more CS News and CS Blog articles about the Yurt, please click here . “The #YurtAtBrown hashtag documents a milestone,” says Professor David Laidlaw of Brown University’s Computer Science Department (Brown CS). “2015 will be a landmark year for visualization at Brown and an evolutionary, transformative leap for the field.” This leads to an obvious question: other than a dwelling of the Central Asian steppes, what is the Yurt? The Yurt (YURT Ultimate Reality Theatre) is the vastly-enhanced successor to Brown’s renowned virtual reality display, the Cave (CAVE™ Automatic Virtual Environment), celebrated for its research, computing, and educational advancements in fields as diverse as archaeology, sculpture, and neuroscience. “With the Yurt,” David explains, “our design goals were to match or exceed human perceptual abilities in every aspect of virtual reality by eliminating gaps, brightening colors, and increasing resolution. Remember how you felt when your phone’s display jumped to retinal quality? Imagine standing in an entire room at that resolution, with pixels that are too small to see individually. It’s world-class virtual reality. If you improved on any of our specifications, the human eye would almost never be able to detect it.” As 2014 winds down, the Yurt is ramping up. The main wall is lit, and the software is blending images well, creating a 24’x8’ 56-million-pixel 3D display. As both hardware (doors being hung and protective floor surfaces laid) and software (image alignment, distributed execution, 3D projection, our VRG3D library, and ultimately applications like CavePainting, Cave Writing, and Adviser) come online, Brown CS will chronicle the journey with behind-the-scenes photos, announcements, tweets, and videos that share the exciting progress step by step. You can take part by visiting the Brown CS homepage , Facebook , and Twitter (follow @browncsdept and look for the #YurtAtBrown hashtag). “We hope people of all backgrounds worldwide will journey with us as we head into, through, and beyond 2015,” says David. “This will be our year of experimentation, about pushing the limits. We don’t want you to miss any of it, because every step we take is going to offer new ideas and opportunities that previously didn’t exist. We want thought leaders running their software here, finding the best and highest uses for the Yurt so we can share them with the world. Any field can gain from the Yurt’s capabilities, and there’s nobody who benefits from the arts, sciences, education or other disciplines who won’t someday be impacted.

Brown University computer science concentrator Aaron Gokaslan ’18 and a team of his peers have just won a Best iOS App award from Apple at the recent HackPrinceton hackathon, earning an iPad Mini and the envy of several hundred of the country’s best young computer scientists. The event, which has been held semiannually for a number of years, challenged students of all levels to join together and create unique software applications. “I was confident,” Aaron explains, “but the competition was intense. I truly enjoyed it, regardless of the outcome, but I only slept a few hours that weekend. I was actually pretty surprised that we won!” For this particular award, participants were required to design the best all-around iOS application that relied solely on software as opposed to hardware. The criteria included functionality, design, and ease of use. Aaron and his teammates won for their application, Rabal , which functions as a universal translator. “The name is an acronym of our team’s first names: Ryan Dunn, Aaron Gokaslan, Bryan Ngadimin, Alan Liu, and Leo Shimonaka,” Aaron explains. “Except over Facebook, I didn’t know any of my team members before I arrived, and I met two of them over Chinese food the first night!” Rabal uses text-to-speech APIs (powered by Nuance) to transcribe and then translate audio (powered by Google Translate). A server then posts translations on web pages that are accessible from any Internet-enabled device, including wearables. The application currently features eight languages, and Aaron notes that it could easily be extended to at least twenty-three. “I had a great time meeting new people and seeing old friends,” Aaron says of the event. “It was exciting throughout: we didn’t even have a working model until a half-hour before the submission deadline and had to re-purpose one of my teammate’s websites to get the setup working. There were some really innovative hacks, and I’m proud that we competed so well among them.”Brown CS Blog Categories Awards (                                        23 articles                                    ) Diversity (                                        72 articles                                    ) Socially Responsible Computing (                                        17 articles                                    ) Outstanding Student Work, 2014: Flick, By Gabriel Fernandez Posted by Jesse Polhemus on Jan. 28, 2015 As a department, how do we evaluate our success? Continued innovation from our students means that we've aimed courses at the field's best opportunities, then taught them with real devotion to our craft. Together, that enables students to produce work that advances the state of the art. In this series, we'll showcase some of the outstanding student work of 2014 : Flick designed by Gabriel Fernandez for CS 1300: Designing, Developing and Evaluating User Interfaces taught by Jeff Huang for Brown CS Gabriel describes his project by saying: "An application that runs on top of every other app on your Mac desktop, Flick answers the question of what a mouse without physical buttons would look like. It follows your mouse around, listening to all movement events. Once it has determined that some specific gesture has been made, it fires a click event that other applications, or even the OS, will capture." For a better understanding of how this works, look at the project's repo here: https://github.com/circuitlego/flick . Gabriel also notes that Flick currently supports the most used mouse operations: Click, Double Click, Right Click, and Drag. You can watch a video of Flick being used here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LWpx5TRWjg .Brown CS Blog Categories Awards (                                        23 articles                                    ) Diversity (                                        72 articles                                    ) Socially Responsible Computing (                                        17 articles                                    ) Brown CS Brings An Hour Of Code To 130+ Kids Posted by Elizabeth Hilliard on Dec. 17, 2014 in Diversity Community outreach connects Brown CS students to the Providence area. For more articles on how Brown CS students inspire and lead members of the greater Providence community click here . For the second year in a row, Brown Computer Science brought an Hour of Code to Providence students at Nathan Bishop Middle School. Hour of Code is a global initiative run by Code.org to bring programming to everyone, especially young students and those that are underrepresented in computing. President Obama kicked off the weeklong event by learning to write some Javascript. This year Professor Amy Greenwald, graduate students David Abel, Amy Becker, Betsy Hilliard, Michael Majzoub (seen in the photo above), and Jeff Rasley, and undergraduate Luke Camery, visited all ten Gateway to Tech classes (more than 130 6th, 7th, and 8th graders) at Nathan Bishop, and introduced them to the Scratch programming language. A handful of the students had some experience, having worked with us last year, but most were new to programming. After about ten minutes of formal instruction, the students were free to work on their own ideas, with us wandering around the classroom giving them input and answering their questions. Mike noted, "The student projects were incredible -- ranging from cartoons to video games. I was amazed with how much they were able to do in just one class period. They were also great at helping one another out as they gained a greater understanding of the programming interface." Even more important than what they made or learned about Scratch, however, was what they realized about themselves. Amy Becker remarked, “There seemed to be a mentality among the students that there was one right procedure...My favorite part of the experience was witnessing the transition as they went from asking me what the right way was, to exploring what they could make the program do on their own. They experienced the loss of inhibitions and fear of being wrong. It was awesome to watch a student who had been initially hesitant show me what they had figured out and take pride and ownership of their creation.” For me, watching kids hit “run” on their first program is always a special moment. It’s exciting to see the pure joy --joy in the creativity and joy in the empowerment-- when students realize they just programmed a computer. It reminds me why I got into Computer Science in the first place.Brown CS Blog Categories Awards (                                        23 articles                                    ) Diversity (                                        72 articles                                    ) Socially Responsible Computing (                                        17 articles                                    ) Brown CS Supports Brown's First Feminist Conference For RI High School Students Posted by Jesse Polhemus on Feb. 15, 2015 in Diversity Community outreach connects Brown CS students to the Providence area.

To read more on this topic, click here . On April 12, 2015, Brown University students Laura Shea ‘18 (a computer science and math concentrator) and I (also ‘18, a computer science concentrator) came in second place in software at HackPrinceton. Our team, with fellow students Ergeta Muca and Anthony Lobko, designed a website to convert files into videos, which are then uploaded to YouTube. We pitched that this turns YouTube into free, unlimited cloud storage. The website, which we’re calling Osiris, uses python, ffmpeg, x264, Django, and Amazon web services. Osiris--the Egyptian mythological figure--suffered the fate of having his body cut into several pieces, scattered throughout Egypt, and then put back together. As our website supports video hosting sites in addition to YouTube, users can symbolically scatter and retrieve data in a similar manner. The website is currently offline while we work on moving some of the heavy computation. Laura and I met our teammates Ergeta and Anthony at the hackathon, and it was rewarding and enjoyable to work with new people. Coincidentally, I won an award in the fall with a different random team, and several of that team’s members ended up in the same computer lab as we did! To add to the parallelism, they won second place in hardware. All in all, the experience was unforgettable and adds to a successful Hackathon season for both Brown and myself.Brown CS Blog Categories Awards (                                        23 articles                                    ) Diversity (                                        72 articles                                    ) Socially Responsible Computing (                                        17 articles                                    ) Brown CS Sponsors Afterschool Program To Teach Programming To Middle-School Children Posted by Jesse Polhemus on March 16, 2015 in Diversity Community outreach connects Brown CS students to the Providence area.
